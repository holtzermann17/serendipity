\subsection{Using SPECS to evaluate computational serendipity}\label{specs-overview}

In a 2012 special issue of the journal {\em Cognitive Computation}, on
``Computational Creativity, Intelligence and Autonomy'', Jordanous
analyses current evaluation procedures used in computational
creativity, and provides a much-needed set of customisable evaluation
guidelines, the \emph{Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative
  Systems} (SPECS) \cite{jordanous:12}.

We propose a slightly modified version of her earlier evaluation
guidelines, in that rather than attempt a definition and evaluation of
{\em creativity}, we follow the three steps for \emph{serendipity}.

\subsubsection*{Step 1: A computational definition of serendipity}
\begin{quote} {\em Identify a definition of serendipity that your
    system should satisfy to be considered serendipitous.}\end{quote}

\noindent As above.
%% This situation can be pictured schematically as follows:
