The features of this model match and expand upon Merton's
\citeyear{merton1948bearing} description of the ``serendipity
pattern.'' $T$ is an unexpected observation; $T^\star$ highlights its
interesting or anomalous features and recasts them as ``strategic
data.''  Finally, the result $R$ and its evaluation may lead to
updates to the system's operations that will inform further phases of
research.
