\section{Our computational model of serendipity} \label{sec:our-model}

Figure \ref{fig:model} recapitulates the ideas from the previous
section.

Figure \ref{fig:1a} is a heuristic map of the features of serendipity
introduced in Section \ref{sec:by-example}.
%
Dashed paths ending in X's show some of the things that can go wrong.
A serendipity trigger might not arise, or might not attract interest.
If interest is aroused, a path to a useful result may not be sought,
or if it is sought, may not be found.  If a result is developed, it
may turn out to be of little value.  Prior experience with a related
problem could be informative, but could also restrict innovative
thinking.  Similarly, multiple tasks, influences, and contexts can
help to foster an inventive frame of mind, but they can also be
distractions.

Figure \ref{fig:1b} removes these unserendipitous paths to focus on
the key features of the model.
%
The \textbf{serendipity trigger} is denoted here by $T$.  
%
The \textbf{prepared mind} corresponds to those preparations, labeled
$p$ and $p^{\prime}$, that are relevant to the discovery and invention
phases, respectively.  These preparations may include training,
current phenomenal experience, access to relevant knowledge sources,
and so on.
%
A \textbf{focus shift} takes place when the trigger is observed to be
interesting.  The now-interesting trigger is denoted $T^\star$, and is
common to both the discovery and the invention phases.
%
%
The \textbf{bridge} is comprised of the actions based on $p^{\prime}$
that are taken on $T^\star$ leading to the \textbf{result} $R$, which is ultimately given a positive evaluation.

Figure \ref{fig:1c} expands this schematic into a sketch of the
components of one possible idealised implementation of a serendipitous
system.  An initial \emph{generative process} is assumed at the start.
This may be based on observations of the outside world, or it may be a
computational process.  In any case, elements from a data stream are
passed on to the next stage of the process.  After running a feedback
loop, some of this data is singled out, and perhaps further marked up,
so that it becomes ``interesting.''  Note that this designation need
not arise all at once: rather, it the outcome of a \emph{reflective
  process}.  In the implementation envisioned here, this process makes
use of two primary functions: $p_1$, which notices aspects of the
data, and $p_2$, which offers additional reflections.  Together, these
functions produce a ``feedback object,'' $T^{\star}$, which consists
of the original data and added metadata.  This is passed on to an
\emph{experimental process}, which has the task of understanding what
makes the data interesting and what it may be useful for.  This is
again an iterative process.  Once sufficient understanding of the data
and its potential implications has been reached, a result is
generated, which is passed to a final \emph{evaluation process}, and,
from there, to applications.  

The ellipses in the final step are meant to suggest that applications
are open-ended; however, an important class of applications will
result in changes to one or more of the system's modules, for example
by expanding the knowledge base used by one or more of the components.
Note that earlier components of the workflow cannot, in general,
anticipate what the subsequent phases will produce or achieve.  If
these operations could be anticipated, we would not say that the
system was serendipitous.  Another way to put this is that serendipity
does not adhere to one specific part of the system, but to its
operations as a whole.  Furthermore, a machine could be built that
implements all of the steps depicted in this diagram, and yet, if it
only generated uninteresting results it would not be called
``serendipitous.''

Summarising, we propose the following definition for serendipity,
expressed in two phases.

\begin{quote}
\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=2pt,labelwidth=9em,leftmargin=7em,rightmargin=2em]
\item[\emph{(\textbf{1 - Discovery})}] \emph{Within a system with a prepared mind, a previously uninteresting serendipity trigger arises due to circumstances that the system does not control, and is classified as interesting by the system; and,}
\item[\emph{(\textbf{2 - Invention})}] \emph{The system, by subsequently processing this trigger and background information together with relevant reasoning, networking, or experimental techniques, obtains a novel result that is evaluated favourably by the system or by external sources.}
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

The features of our model match and expand upon Merton's
\citeyear{merton1948bearing} description of the ``serendipity
pattern.'' $T$ is an unexpected observation; $T^\star$ highlights its
interesting or anomalous features and recasts them as ``strategic
data.''  Finally, the result $R$ and its evaluation may lead to
updates to the system's operations that will inform further phases of
research.  As we will show in the following section, the other
elements of the conceptual framework described in Section
\ref{sec:by-example} help to flesh out the model, to offer quite
detailed evaluation criteria.
