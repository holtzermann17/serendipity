The features of our model matches and expands upon Merton's \citeyear{merton1948bearing} description of the ``serendipity pattern.'' $T$ is an unexpected observation; $T^\star$ highlights its interesting or anomalous features and recasts them as ``strategic data''; and, finally, the result $R$ may include updates to $p$ or $p^{\prime}$ that inform further phases of research.  

Although they do not directly figure in our definition, the supportive
dimensions and factors can be interpreted using this schematic to
flesh out the description of serendipity in working systems.

From the point of view of the system under consideration, $T$ is
indeterminate.  Furthermore, one must assume that relatively few of
triggers $T^\star$ that are identified as interesting actually lead to
useful results; in other words, the process is fallible and
\textbf{chance} is likely to play a role.
%
The prior training $p$ causes interesting features
to be extracted, even if they are not necessarily useful; $p^{\prime}$
asks how these features \emph{might} be useful.  These routines 
suggest the relevance of a computational model of \textbf{curiousity}.
%
Rather than a simple look-up rule, $p^{\prime}$ involves creating new knowledge.  A simple example is found in clustering systems, which generate new categories on the fly.  A more complicated example, necessary in the case of updating $p$ or $p^{\prime}$, is automatic programming.  There is ample room for \textbf{sagacity} in this affair.
%
Judgment of the \textbf{value} of the result $R$ may be carried out
``locally'' (as an embedded part of the process of invention of $R$)
or ``globally'' (i.e.~as an external process).

As noted, $T$ (and $T^\star$) appears within a stream of data with
indeterminacy.  There is an additional feedback loop, insofar as
products $R$ influence the future state and behaviour of the system.
Thus, the system exists in a \textbf{dynamic world}.
%
Our model separates the
``context of discovery'', involving prior preparations $p$, from the
``context of invention'' involving prior preparations $p^{\prime}$.
Both of these, and the data they deal with, may be subdivided further into \textbf{multiple contexts}. 
%
And correspondingly, since both $T$ and $T^\star$ may be complex, they
may be processed using multiple sub-processes that deal with
\textbf{multiple tasks} using different skills sets.
%
The process as a whole may be multiplied out across different
communicating investigators, so that the final result bears the mark
of \textbf{multiple influences}.
