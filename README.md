# Modelling serendipity in a computational context

Drawing on well-known examples of serendipity in scientific discovery,
we develop a set of criteria that can be applied to model and evaluate
serendipity in computational settings.  We use design patterns, and
the growth of a pattern language, as a way to describe the processes
of discovery and invention that comprise serendipitous encounters.  We
show how several earlier patterns of serendipity can be applied in a
Writers Workshop for computational systems, and include related
recommendations for practitioners.

## Status

When we have addressed the [outstanding issues](https://github.com/holtzermann17/serendipity/issues) pointed out by previous reviewers, we plan to submit the revised paper to [Minds and Machines](http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/11023).
