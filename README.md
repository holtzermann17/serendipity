# Modelling serendipity in a computational context

Drawing on well-known examples of serendipity in scientific discovery,
we develop a set of criteria that can be applied to model and evaluate
serendipity in computational settings.  We use design patterns, and
the growth of a pattern language, as a way to describe the processes
of discovery and invention that comprise serendipitous encounters.  We
show how several earlier patterns of serendipity can be applied in a
Writers Workshop for computational systems, and include related
recommendations for practitioners.

# Plan of Action

1. (Joe, Alison): Significantly clarify the argument and summarise it in
the introduction.
 -   We are offering one possible computational definition of serendipity
 -   Serendipity is not the same as luck.  It’s a matter of learning
     something, in a way that’s unanticipated.  Looking for something and
     finding something else.
 -   Explain the aspects of the model better, e.g. why is it essential
     that the trigger is not under the control of the system.
 -   Clearly summarise the offering of the paper.
2. (Joe): Move our formal definition of serendipity (e.g. the diagram) up
to meet the literature review, as a new section ‘Formal definition of
Serendipity’. (It’s a key contribution of the paper.)
 -   We will clearly connect the heuristic criteria from Alison with the
     figure.
 -   In addition a quick graphical summary of the 13 criteria
3. (Joe): Drop sections 3 and 4, and move key concepts to “future work”
 -   Section 3 (FloWr) -\> heavily condense and put into future work
     (some overview of Joe’s concrete implementation plans).  Explain
     with minimal references.
 -   Section 4 (Design patterns) - heavily condensed - “Just So Stories”
     paragraph in Section 5.3 as a potential application.  Explain some
     history about design patterns and say that, for serendipity, the
     question is where do new “design” ideas come from.  (I.e. discovery
     of a new approach.)  But make this future work.
 -   “We are highlighting how design patterns and the other ideas in this
     paper could be used to build a context where serendipity will take
     place.”
4. (Anna): Remove Section 5.3 (save it for another paper about Writers
Workshops).  It’s relevant for “embedded creativity” but “Writers
Workshops” themselves can be a footnote.  The actual idea here is more
general.
 -   Anna can add more about evaluation in the creative process
 -   The idea of the WW (or just social revision) is an example of a
     place where serendipity can occur.
5. (Anna): Leading into our thought experiment: “An emerging theme in
computing is exploitation of social creativity and feedback.  Our
computational model contributes to theorising this work.”
 -   Include another example with computational serendipity?  Maybe the
     example from Kaz’s thesis
 -   It would not be hard to find an example of a music system noticing
     that a note was wrong and playing.  Make sure we include at least
     one example that is not “technically improbable” -- better to
     include several that have been realised (e.g. Copycat)
6. (Christian): Copycat or any other historical examples of serendipity
in computing, or explanation of why there are none (argue for or
against, in the background section, as a new §§, and perhaps again later
in the document as a further analysis to accompany our thought
experiment).
 -   Concrete lower bound examples and counterexamples, e.g. would it be
     possible for “merely generative” systems to exhibit serendipity? --
     case of genetic algorithms
 -   What is the difference between serendipity and good luck? (E.g. a
     random act that leads to an outcome that is evaluated positively.)
 -   What are the strict requirements and what are only the supportive
     factors that make serendipity "likely"? Or is it a matter of degree?
 -   Is it the case that serendipitous systems would be more 'sagacious'
     in recognizing interesting triggers? - explain, especially in
     connection with computational search.
 -   What about 'regular' systems that work by applying inference
     procedures on symbolic representations to yield new representations?
     - e.g. theorem provers
 -   Evaluate existing approaches to “computational learning” - are they
     serendipitous?
7. (Simon, Alison): Clarify the extent to which serendipity is something
that “actually exists” or is something that is only perceived to exist.
 -   It does not seem to be an “essentially contested concept”, just a
     potentially confusing one.  One contribution of the paper is to
     clarify this.
 -   Clarify the relationship to other key concepts in computational
     creativity / creative computing
8. (Alison): Include a section early on that defines any other keywords
that we refer to later, like the word “dynamic”.
9. (Alison): Improve exposition of the analysis of Pek van Andel’s
patterns.
 -   (1) What do we hope to achieve with this analysis, and our diagram?
 -   (2) Have we done the analysis in some verifiable way, i.e. “where
     does the analysis come from (i.e. which aspect occurs in which
     pattern)? Is there clear consensus on this?”
10. (Joe, all): Make referencing less intensive for the reader.
 -   Use APA style referencing and cut down on number of references.
 -   Clearly explain in narrative form what sort of literature we will
     draw on.
 -   Perhaps the historical examples of serendipity should be confined to
     a separate “recommended reading” section and not referenced directly
     in the text.
11. (Christian, Anna): Shorten and improve the literature review.
 -   Preserve key features of the general survey, but include a more
     thorough review of recent related work in computing, including work
     in the Cognitive Computation journal.
 -   There has been prior work on surprise (Mary Lou Maher + Kazjon

     also their paper at ICCC 2013 or 2014) and discovery (Kaz’s AAAI
     paper)
12. (Joe): Confine philosophy references (e.g. Bergson, Deleuze) to the
background section so that it doesn’t confuse anyone about what we’re
actually offering in the paper.
 -   Don’t refer to them in the conclusion, but do summarise the
     contribution of this paper again in the conclusion (hint: it should
     be what we say in the title).
 -   Re-summarise again in the abstract.
