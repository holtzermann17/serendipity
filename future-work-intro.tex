\subsection{Future Work} \label{sec:futurework} \label{sec:hatching}

As a framework for managing the processes of discovery and invention,
we are drawn to the approach taken by the \emph{design pattern}
community \cite{alexander1999origins}, although we
propose to use design patterns in rather nonstandard way:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(1)] We want to encode our design patterns directly in runnable
  programs, not just give them to programmers as heuristic guidance.
\item[(2)] We want the (automated) programmer to generate new design
  patterns, not just apply or adapt old ones.
\item[(3)] We want our design patterns to help find new problems,
  not just capture the solutions to existing ones.
\end{itemize}

\citeA{meszaros1998pattern} describe the typical scenario for design
pattern writers: ``You are an experienced practitioner in your
field. You have noticed that you keep using a certain solution to a
commonly occurring problem. You would like to share your experience
with others.''  They remark, ``What sets patterns apart is their
ability to explain the rationale for using the solution (the `why') in
addition describing the solution (the `how').''  Regarding the
criteria that pattern writers seek to address: ``The most
appropriate solution to a problem in a context is the one that best
resolves the highest priority forces as determined by the particular
context.''  %% Their article describes a number of criteria
%% relevant to writing good design patterns, e.g. \emph{Clear target
%%   audience}, \emph{Visible forces}, and \emph{Relationship to other
%%   patterns}.

A good design pattern \emph{describes} the resolution of forces in the
target domain; in the setting we're interested in, creating a new
design pattern also \emph{effects} a resolution of forces directly.
This use case maps into our diagram of the basic features of serendipity as follows:
