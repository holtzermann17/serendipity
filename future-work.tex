\subsection{Future Work} \label{sec:futurework} \label{sec:hatching}

Merton \citeyear{merton1948bearing} \cite<cited in>[pp. 195--196]{merton} refers to a generalised ``serendipity pattern''
and its constituent parts:

\begin{quote}
\emph{The serendipity pattern refers to the fairly common experience of observing an \emph{unanticipated}, \emph{anomalous} \emph{and strategic} datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory.}~\cite[p. 506]{merton1948bearing} (original emphasis)
    %% The datum [that exerts a pressure for initiating theory] is, first of all, unanticipated. A research directed toward the test of one hypothesis yields a fortuitous by-product, an unexpected observation which bears upon theories not in question when the research was begun.
    %% Secondly, the observation is anomalous, surprising, either because it seems inconsistent with prevailing theory or with other established facts. In either case, the seeming inconsistency provokes curiosity; it stimulates the investigator to "make sense of the datum," to fit it into a broader frame of knowledge....
    %% And thirdly, in noting that the unexpected fact must be "strategic," i. e., that it must permit of implications which bear upon generalized theory, we are, of course, referring rather to what the observer brings to the datum than to the datum itself. For it obviously requires a theoretically sensitized observer to detect the universal in the particular. 
\end{quote}

These features match our earlier description quite well: $T$ is the
unexpected observation; $T^\star$ singles out the interesting or
anomalous features; and the result $R$ may include updates to $p$ or
$p^{\prime}$ that inform further phases of research.
%
Van Andel's \citeyear{van1994anatomy} ``patterns of serendipity'' are
often instances of this broader pattern.

%% \begin{quote}
%% ``Given research set up for a certain purpose, some unexpected, puzzling data, and a scientist capable of being puzzled -- given all of these, an accidental discovery will occur, because the relationship between fact and theory in science is such that it must occur.''
%% \end{quote}


In future work, we would like to explore the usefulness of the
somewhat more formal theory of \emph{design patterns}
\cite{alexander1999origins} for designing with serendipity in mind.
Alexandrian design patterns are by no means limited to computing: the
approach has its origins in architecture and urban planning
\cite{alexander1979timeless,alexander1977pattern}.

Design patterns prescribe and describe: they provide models \emph{for}
as well as models \emph{of}
\cite<cf.>[p. 93]{geertz1973interpretation}.  Thus, when Alexander
describes the pattern \emph{A place to wait}, he is also telling
readers that it may be a good idea to consider building a place to
wait when designing a living environment.

In connection with our understanding of serendipity as closely
associated with deviations from familiar patterns (in the everyday
sense of the word), it is interesting to ask how it can play a role in
the creation of new design patterns and pattern languages.  Noticing
and describing a new pattern is almost the antithesis of ``pattern
recognition'' in the usual computing sense.

As a beginning, we examined the 14 ``patterns of serendipity''
selected and described by van Andel \citeyear{van1994anatomy}, using the criteria
described in our Section \ref{sec:connections-to-formal-definition}.
We found all of these patterns do indeed include a focus shift, a
prepared mind, a serendipity trigger, a bridge, and a result, although
two of the patterns raised questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the case of \emph{Testing popular belief}, van Andel focuses
  on an account of a medical practise that originated in a folk claim,
  namely cowpox-derived immunity to smallpox.  It is challenging in
  this case to identify one specific serendipity trigger -- although a
  curious chain of events connected Edward Jenner with the smallpox
  vaccine.  It may be most appropriate to think of Jenner himself as
  the serendipity trigger at the societal level: his ``relentless
  promotion and devoted research of vaccination \ldots changed the way
  medicine was practised'' \cite{riedel2005edward}.
%% This effect, for milkmaids, might
%% indeed be called serendipitous. Indeed, the medical use of cowpox has
%% been described as ``widely know'' \cite{riedel2005edward} prior to its
%% popularisation by Edward Jenner.  Nevertheless, Jenner's
\item \emph{Inversion} is closer to what is called an
  \emph{antipattern} in the design pattern literature
  \cite{brown1998antipatterns}.  Van Andel describes the story of a
  researcher observing an effect due to the anticoagulant heparine
  which was precisely the opposite of the one sought -- factors that
  \emph{cause} blood clotting -- and then failing to acknowledge that
  this observation was important for over 40 years.  The result was
  eventually seen to be of value, however, again, this may be a
  pattern of \emph{antiserendipity}.
\end{itemize}

Among the 14 patterns, four are cases of ``perfect'' serendipity from
the point of view of our extended set of criteria (i.e.~they included
all of the 13 components, dimensions, and environmental factors) --
these patterns were \emph{Successful error}, \emph{Side effect},
\emph{Wrong hypothesis}, and \emph{Outsider}.
%
We wondered whether these were patterns might be used to support
serendipity in other settings -- such as the Writers Workshop.  Table
\ref{tab:reinterpret} gives an initial sketch, and initial experiments
that will bring this material to computational life are underway.

{\tt listening} & Systems should listen with interest, too. \\
{\tt feedback} & Even interesting ideas may not be ``marketable.''\\
{\tt questions} & How is your suggestion useful? \\
{\tt reflections} & New combinations of ideas take a long time to realise, and many different ideas may need to be combined in order to come up with something useful.\\
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{lp{.7\textwidth}}
{\bf\emph{Side effect}} & \\

{\tt feedback} & Discuss side-effects that do not necessarily correspond to the author's perceived intent. \\

\emph{Van Andel's example}: & A mother suggests a new hypothesis to a doctor. \\[.2cm]
{\tt presentation}& The presenter is here to learn from the audience. \\

\end{table}

Within the context of the ongoing COINVENT project \cite{coinvent14},
we are interested in using design patterns together with computational
blending theory to realise certain aspects of this model in a
stand-alone architecture.
%
It will be useful to consider how we can take both the \emph{discovery
  step}, which combines a serendipity trigger $T$, and prior
preparation $p$ and produces a classification $T^{\star}$ -- and the
\emph{invention step}, which combines the classified trigger
$T^{\star}$, and preparations $p^{\prime}$, and produces a novel
result $R$ -- to be \emph{blends} in the sense of Joseph Goguen
\citeyear{goguen1999introduction}.  

The epistemological framework of discovery gives some important clues
about how to compute a common base between $T$ and $p$.  Although $T$
was previously uninteresting, it will have attributes or
attribute-types that match the patterns recognised by $p$ (e.g. van
Andel's ``\emph{One surprising observation}'').  In the invention
step, reasoning, experimentation, social interaction strategies rely
on $p^{\prime}$, which might draw on patterns like \emph{Successful
  error}, in order to extract a fruitful result from $T^{\star}$.
Here, an important guidepost for implementation is that many outcomes
will result in new patterns of behaviour that the system can draw on
in subsequent interactions.
