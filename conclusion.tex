\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

%
We began by surveying ``serendipity'', developing a broad historical
view, and several criteria which are computationally feasible.  Along
similar lines to \citeA{andre2009discovery}, we propose a two-part
definition of serendipity: \emph{discovery} followed by
\emph{invention}.
%
Adapting the ``Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative
Systems'' we developed a set of assessment standards for serendipity.
%
We used this model to examine several prior examples of serendipity,
and developed a thought experiment that exhibits ``high serendipity''
a novel and computationally feasible design.
%
We then extracted several corollaries of our definition, which outline
a programme for serendipitous computing in the pursuit of
\emph{autonomy}, \emph{learning}, \emph{sociality}, and \emph{embedded
  evaluation and ethics}.

The argument presented here is not supported by experimental results,
but focuses on clarifying conceptual issues and examining design
implications, which we believe are appropriate to this phase of
research.
% 
The article points to several possible further directions for
implementation work in each of our case studies.  It also points to
theoretical questions about how to best do program design in an
autonomous programming context.  Our examples show that serendipity is
not alien to computing.  There are further gains to be had by planning
-- and programming -- for serendipity.
