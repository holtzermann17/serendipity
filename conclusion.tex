\section{Conclusion}

In his treatise on logic and scientific method, W. Stanley Jevons
wrote:
\begin{quote}
``\emph{sufficient investigation would probably show that almost every
    branch of art and science had an accidental beginning} \ldots
  \emph{With the progress of any branch of science, the element of
    chance becomes much reduced}'' \cite[p. 531]{jevons:1877}
\end{quote}
We are still in early days for intelligent machines, where serendipity
may play a significant role in fundamental aspects of both theory and
practise.  However, we foresee it playing a continued and indeed
central role within intelligent systems, for which there is always
something new to learn.
