\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

%
We began by surveying ``serendipity'', developing a broad historical
view, and several criteria which are computationally feasible.  Along
similar lines to \citeA{andre2009discovery}, we propose a two-part
definition of serendipity: \emph{discovery} followed by
\emph{invention}.
%
Adapting the ``Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative
Systems'' (SPECS) model, we developed a set of evaluation standards for
serendipity.
%
We used this model to analyse prior examples of serendipity in the context of evolutionary music improvisation and recommender systems,
and developed a thought experiment for expressing ``high serendipity'' in a novel and computationally feasible design.
%
We then extracted several corollaries of our definition, which outline
a programme for serendipitous computing in the pursuit of
\emph{autonomy}, \emph{learning}, \emph{sociality}, and \emph{embedded
  evaluation}.

In the current work, we have limited ourselves to clarifying conceptual
issues and examining design implications.
% 
We indicate several possible further directions for implementation
work in each of our case studies.  We have also drawn attention to
theoretical questions related to doing program design in an autonomous
programming context.  Our examples show that serendipity is not
foreign to computing practice.  There are further gains to be had for
research in computing by planning -- and programming -- for
serendipity.
