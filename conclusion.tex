\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

% What answers have we offered?
The ideas presented in this article present several interesting
directions for implementation, but considerable concrete work remains
to be done in order to realise the model in code.  We examined a
number of prior computational systems that match some aspects of our
model, but even these hand-picked examples pale in comparison to the
examples of serendipitous discovery from human history.  It would seem
that a fully-automated system that can realistically be said to behave
in a serendipitous manner has not yet been built.
% Further questions
The theoretical work in this paper shows that it is indeed possible to
plan -- and program -- for serendipity.
