This is left unsaid by Ritchie except for a small section in p. 93 Q. reliance on inspiring set - does this mean that Ritchie's criteria are heavily influenced by a case-based reasoning type approach? e.g. criteria 9 checks that the examples in the inspiring set can be replicated - what if this isn't important in your system (for example... ***) or if there is no inspiring set? (*** check feedback from ICCCX paper as I think this is discussed there ***) Q. In fact is the whole approach too closely fitted to a computational approach such as used by Ritchie in JAPE or STANDUP, at the expense of applying more generally to a variety of approaches? For debate about computer creativity: Dreyfus 1979, Lovelace, Weizenbaum 1976 Computer power and human reason It is outside the scope of this paper to build a model of creativity or of the creative process, or to define what is neeeded to show evidence of creativity (p. 68). The aim is to formally define observable factors which possibly relate to creativity.},
