\subsection{Etymology and selected definitions} \label{sec:overview-serendipity}  
The English term ``serendipity'' derives from the 1302 long poem \emph{Eight Paradises}, written in Persian by the Sufi poet Am\={\i}r Khusrow in Uttar Pradesh, India.  After translations into Italian, French, and finally English, its first chapter was known as ``The Three Princes of Serendip'', where ``Serendip'' ultimately corresponds to the Old Tamil-Malayalam word for Sri Lanka (%{\tam சேரன்தீவு},
\emph{Cerantivu}, island of the Ceran kings).
%
The term ``serendipity'' is first found in a 1757 letter by Horace Walpole to Horace Mann:
\begin{quote}
\emph{``This discovery is almost of that kind which I call serendipity, a very expressive
word} \ldots \emph{You will understand it better by the derivation than by the
definition. I once read a silly fairy tale, called The Three Princes of Serendip:
as their Highness travelled, they were always making discoveries, by accidents
\& sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of}[.]''~\cite[p. 633]{van1994anatomy}
\end{quote}
The same story formed part of the inspiration for Voltaire's \emph{Zadig}, and ``the method of Zadig'' was used as a term of art in 19th Century philosophy of science \cite{huxley1894science}.
Walpole's term ``serendipity'' was used in print only 135 times before 1958, according to the survey carried out by Robert Merton and Elinor Barber, collected in \emph{The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity} \citep{merton}.  Merton describes his own understanding of a generalised ``serendipity pattern'' and its constituent parts as follows:

\begin{quote}
``\emph{The serendipity pattern refers to the fairly common experience of observing an \emph{\textbf{unanticipated}}, \emph{\textbf{anomalous}} \emph{\textbf{and strategic}} datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory.}''~\cite[p. 506]{merton1948bearing}~{[}emphasis in original{]}
    %% The datum [that exerts a pressure for initiating theory] is, first of all, unanticipated. A research directed toward the test of one hypothesis yields a fortuitous by-product, an unexpected observation which bears upon theories not in question when the research was begun.
    %% Secondly, the observation is anomalous, surprising, either because it seems inconsistent with prevailing theory or with other established facts. In either case, the seeming inconsistency provokes curiosity; it stimulates the investigator to "make sense of the datum," to fit it into a broader frame of knowledge....
    %% And thirdly, in noting that the unexpected fact must be "strategic," i. e., that it must permit of implications which bear upon generalized theory, we are, of course, referring rather to what the observer brings to the datum than to the datum itself. For it obviously requires a theoretically sensitized observer to detect the universal in the particular. 
\end{quote}

In 1986, Philippe Qu\'eau described serendipity as ``the art of
finding what we are not looking for by looking for what we are not
finding'' (\citeA{eloge-de-la-simulation}, as quoted in
\cite[p. 121]{Campos2002}).  Campbell
\citeyear{campbell2005serendipity} defines it as ``the rational
exploitation of chance observation, especially in the discovery of
something useful or beneficial.''  Pek van Andel
\citeyear[p. 631]{van1994anatomy} describes it simply as ``the art of
making an unsought finding.''


Roberts \citeyear[pp. 246--249]{roberts} records 30 entries for the term ``serendipity'' from English language dictionaries dating from 1909 to 1989.  
%
Classic definitions require the investigator not to be aware of the problem they serendipitously solve, but this criterion has largely dropped from dictionary definitions. Only 5 of Roberts' collected definitions explicitly say ``not sought for.''  Roberts characterises ``sought findings'' in which the discovery nevertheless follows from an accident as \emph{pseudoserendipity}, after \citeA{chumaceiro1995serendipity}.
%
While Walpole initially described serendipity as an event
(i.e., a kind of discovery), it has
since been reconceptualised as a psychological attribute, a matter of
sagacity on the part of the discoverer: a ``gift'' or ``faculty.''
Only one of Roberts collected definitions defined it solely as an event, while five define it as both
event and attribute.

Nevertheless, numerous historical examples exhibit features of
serendipity and develop on a social scale rather than an individual
scale.  For instance, between Spencer Silver's creation of high-tack,
low-adhesion glue in 1968, Arthur Fry's invention of a sticky bookmark in 1973,
and the eventual launch of the distinctive canary yellow re-stickable
notes in 1980, there were many opportunities for
Post-it\texttrademark\ Notes \emph{not} to have come to be
\cite{tce-postits}.  Merton and Barber argue that the
psychological perspective needs to be integrated with a
sociological perspective.
\begin{quote}
``\emph{For if chance favours prepared minds, it particularly favours
    those at work in microenvironments that make for unanticipated
    sociocognitive interactions between those prepared minds. These
    may be described as serendipitous sociocognitive
    microenvironments.}'' \cite[p. 259--260]{merton}
\end{quote}
Large-scale scientific and technical projects generally rely on the
convergence of interests of key actors and on other cultural factors.
For example, Umberto Eco describes the historical role of
serendipitous mistakes, falsehoods, and rumors in the production of
knowledge \citeyear{eco2013serendipities}.

Serendipity is usually discussed within
the context of \emph{discovery}, rather than \emph{creativity},
although in everyday parlance the latter two terms are closely related
\cite{jordanous12jims}.  In the definition of serendipity that we present in Section \ref{sec:our-model}, we make use
of Henri Bergson's distinction:
\begin{quote}
%% \emph{``La d\'ecouverte porte sur ce qui existe d\'ej\`a, actuellement
%%   ou virtuelle­ment ; elle \'etait donc s\^ure de venir t\^ot ou
%%   tard. L'invention donne l'\^etre \`a ce qui n'\'etait pas, elle
%%   aurait pu ne venir jamais.''}
``\emph{Discovery, or uncovering, has to do with what already exists,
    actually or virtually; it was therefore certain to happen sooner
    or later.  Invention gives being to what did not exist; it might
    never have happened.}''~\cite[p. 58]{bergson2010creative}
\end{quote}
As we have indicated, serendipity would seem to require features of
both discovery and invention: that is, the \emph{discovery} of
something unexpected in the world and the \emph{invention} of an
application for the same.  \citeA{mckay-serendipity} draws on the same
Bergsonian distinction to frame her argument about the role of
serendipity in artistic practice, where discovery and invention can be
seen as ongoing and diverse.  This underscores the relationship
between serendipity and creativity.

Following \citeA{austin2003chase}, \citeA{cropley2006praise} understands serendipity to
describe the case of a person who ``stumbles upon something novel and
effective when not looking for it.''  Nearby categories are
\emph{blind luck}, the \emph{luck of the diligent} (or
pseudoserendipity) and \emph{self-induced luck}; however, Cropley
questions ``whether it is a matter of luck at all'' because of the
work and knowledge involved in the process of assessment.
%
The perspective developed in the current paper sharpens these
understandings in two ways: firstly, we point out that work is
involved in both phases of the process (even when chance plays a
role), and secondly, following Bergson we defer true ``novelty'' to
the invention phase.
%% In other words, serendipity involves creative making.  Furthermore, we
%% emphasise the importance of active, agential discernment over more
%% passive stumbling.

%% According to Arthur Cropley, creative thinking involves:
%% \begin{quote}
%% ``{[}N{]}\emph{ovelty generation followed by (or accompanied by) exploration of the novelty from the point of view of workability, acceptability, or similar criteria, in order to determine if it is effective.}'' \cite{cropley2006praise}
%% \end{quote}

We can point to process-level parallels between definitions of
serendipity like Merton's, quoted above, and previous definitions of
creativity.  Cs\'ikszentmih\'alyi's perspective is particularly
suggestive regarding the way in which unanticipated, anomalous, and
strategic data might arise and move through a social system:
\begin{quote}
``{[}C{]}\emph{reativity results from the interaction of a system
    composed of three elements: a culture that contains 
   \emph{\textbf{symbolic rules}}, a person who brings 
    \emph{\textbf{novelty}} into the symbolic domain, and a
    field of experts who recognize and 
    \emph{\textbf{validate}} the innovation.}''
  \cite[p.~6]{csikszentmihalyi1997flow}~{[}emphasis added{]}
\end{quote}
%% Although there are common features to existing definitions of
%% creativity, and again, much in common with serendipity,
%% there is also much disagreement and discussion -- for example,
%% about the relevance of the social context.

An often-cited five-stage model of creativity, based on
\emph{preparation}, \emph{incubation}, \emph{insight},
\emph{evaluation}, followed by \emph{elaboration} \citeA[pp.~79--80,
  after \citeA{wallas1926art}]{csikszentmihalyi1997flow} parallels the
model of serendipity that we develop in Section \ref{sec:our-model}.
%%
There, we adapt a general-purpose framework for evalutating creative
systems \cite{jordanous:12} to use in evaluating a system's potential
for serendipity.  These evaluations assume that several relatively
generic criteria may be measured.  The following section surveys those
criteria.

\subsection{Serendipity by example: the condition, components, dimensions, and factors of serendiptious occurrences} \label{sec:by-example}

% This section introduces key concepts for understanding serendipitous occurrences, and illustrates them by means of historical examples.
%% We adapt the conceptual framework proposed by
%% \citeA{pease2013discussion}.

\subsubsection{Key condition for serendipity.}

Serendipity relies on a reassessment or reevaluation -- a \emph{focus shift} in which something that was previously uninteresting, of neutral, or even negative value, becomes interesting.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Focus shift}: George de Mestral, an electrical engineer
  by training, and an experienced inventor, returned from a hunting
  trip in the Alps.  He removed several burdock burrs from his clothes
  and his dog's fur and became curious about how they worked. After
  examining them under a microscope, he realised the possibility of
  creating a new kind of fastener that worked in a similar fashion,
  laying the foundations for the hook-and-loop mechanism in Velcro\texttrademark.
% \cite[p. x]{roberts}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Components of serendipity.}

A focus shift is brought about by the meeting of a \emph{prepared mind} and a \emph{trigger}.  The next step involves building a \emph{bridge} to a valuable \emph{result}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prepared mind}: 
Alexander Fleming's ``prepared mind'' included his focus
on carrying out experiments to investigate influenza as well as his
previous experience that showed that foreign substances in petri dishes can kill
bacteria.  He was concerned above all with the question ``Is there a
substance which is harmful to harmful bacteria but harmless to human
tissue?''  \cite[p. 161]{roberts}.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Trigger}: The trigger does not directly
  cause the outcome, but rather, inspires a new insight.  It was long
  known by Quechua medics that cinchona bark stops shivering.  In
  particular, it worked well to stop shivering in malaria patients, as
  was observed when malarial Europeans first arrived in Peru.  The
  joint appearance of shivering Europeans and a South American remedy
  was the trigger.  That an extract from cinchona bark can cure and
  can even prevent malaria was learned subsequently.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bridge}: The bridge often includes reasoning techniques,
  such as abductive inference (what might cause a clear patch in a
  petri dish?), analogical reasoning (de Mestral constructed a target
  domain from the source domain of burrs hooked onto fabric), or
  conceptual blending (Kekul\'e, discoverer of the benzene ring
  structure, blended his knowledge of molecule structure with his
  dream image of a snake biting its tail).  The bridge may be
  non-conceptual, relying on new social arrangements, or physical
  prototypes.  It may have many steps, and may itself feature chance
  elements.  Several serendipitous episodes may be chained together in
  sequence, on the way to an unprecedented result.  C\'edric Villani
  \citeyear[pp.~15--16]{birth-of-a-theorem} describes two hallway
  conversations that happened in one day, the first with Freddy
  Bouchet, about the way galaxies stabilise -- ``I was thrilled to see
  Landau damping suddenly make another appearance, scarcely more than
  a week after my discussion with Cl\'ement [Mouhot]'' -- and the
  second with his colleague \'Etienne Ghys, who offered an unexpected
  link to Komolgorov-Arnold-Moser theory: ``I didn't really want to
  say anything, C\'edric, but those figures there on the board -- I've
  seen them before.''
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Result}: This is the new product, artefact, process,
  theory, use for a material substance, or other outcome.  The
  outcome may contribute evidence in support of a known hypothesis, or
  a solution to a known problem.  Alternatively, the result may itself
  {\em be} a new hypothesis or problem.  The result may be
  ``pseudoserendipitous'' in the sense that it was {\em sought}, while
  nevertheless arising from an unknown, unlikely, coincidental or
  unexpected source.  More classically, it is an \emph{unsought}
  finding, such as the discovery of the Rosetta stone.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Dimensions of serendipity.}

The four components described above have attributes that may be present to a greater or lesser degree.  These are: \emph{Chance} -- how likely was the trigger to appear?; \emph{Curiosity} -- how likely was this trigger to be identified as interesting?; \emph{Sagacity} -- how likely was it that the interesting trigger would be turned into a result?; -- and \emph{Value} (how valuable is the result that is ultimately produced?).

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chance}: Fleming \citeyear{fleming} noted: ``There are
  thousands of different moulds'' -- and ``that chance put the mould
  in the right spot at the right time was like winning the Irish
  sweep.''  It is important to notice that \emph{he} was in the right
  spot at the right time as well -- and that this was not a complete
  coincidence.  The chance events we're interested in always include
  at least one observer.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Curiosity}: Curiosity can dispose a creative person to
  begin or to continue a search into unfamiliar territory.  We use
  this word to describe both simple curiosity and related deeper
  drives.  Charles Goodyear \citeyear{goodyear1855gum} discoverer of
  the process for vulcanising rubber, first noticed that when the
  compound he was working with ``being carelessly brought into contact
  with a hot stove, charred like leather'' and in subsequent
  experiments observed that ``upon the edge of the charred portion
  appeared a line or border, that was not charred, but perfectly
  cured.''  In his autobiography he reflects on the role curiosity
  played in shaping his career: ``[F]rom the time his attention was
  first given to the subject, a strong and abiding impression was made
  upon his mind, that an object so desirable and important, and so
  necessary to man's comfort, as the making of gum-elastic available
  to his use, was most certainly placed within his reach.  Having this
  presentiment, of which he could not divest himself, under the most
  trying adversity, he was stimulated with the hope of ultimately
  attaining this object.''
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sagacity}: This old-fashioned word is related to
  ``wisdom,'' ``insight,'' and especially to ``taste'' -- and
  describes the attributes, or skill, of the discoverer that
  contribute to forming the bridge between the trigger and the result.
  Merton \citeyearpar[p.~507]{merton1948bearing} writes: ``{[}M{]}en
  had for centuries noticed such `trivial' occurrences as slips of the
  tongue, slips of the pen, typographical errors, and lapses of
  memory, but it required the theoretic sensitivity of a Freud to see
  these as strategic data through which he could extend his theory of
  repression and symptomatic acts.''  The degree to which such data
  are \emph{prima facie} unanticipated and anomalous is clear.  Merton
  seems prepared to accept without complaint that Freud's claims
  surrounding this data are part of ``an idealized story''
  \cite{freudtheory}.  For Merton ``what the observer brings to the
  datum'' is an essential aspect of strategy; his key criterion is
  that the result ``must permit of implications which bear upon
  generalised theory'' -- not that it be correct.  The dimension of
  sagacity can also go some way towards describing, if not explaining,
  how it is this person rather than that person makes a particular
  societal contribution.  For example, Edward Jenner was not the first
  person to observe that cowpox innoculation prevents smallpox
  contagion, but his experimental verification of this principle, and
  his development and promotion of the first ``vaccines'' were
  important scientific and social advances \cite{riedel2005edward}.
\end{itemize}

%% Note that the chance ``discovery'' of, say, a \pounds 10 note may
%% be seen as happy by the person who finds it, whereas the loss of
%% the same note would generally be regarded as unhappy.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Value}: Serendipity concerns happy surprises, but
  different parties may have different judgements as to whether a
  given situation is ``happy'' or ``surprising''.  A third party
  judgement of value can help to discriminate between luck, sleight of
  hand, and bona fide value creation.  Consider the difference between
  the two sayings ``One man's loss is another man's gain'' and ``One
  man's trash is another man's treasure.''  A literal example of the
  latter scenario is provided by the Swiss company Freitag, which was
  started by design students who built a business around ``upcycling''
  used truck tarpaulins into bags and backpacks.  Thanks in part to
  clever marketing \cite[pp. 54--55, 68--69]{russo2010companies},
  their product is now a global brand.  Wherever possible, we prefer
  to make use of independent judgements of value, which helps to
  capture a non-zero sum notion of value.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Environmental factors.}

Finally, serendipity seems to be more likely for agents who experience and participate in a \emph{dynamic world}, who are active in \emph{multiple contexts}, occupied with \emph{multiple tasks}, and who avail themselves of \emph{multiple influences}.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dynamic world}: Information about the world develops
  over time, and is not presented as a complete, consistent whole.  In
  particular, \emph{value} may come later.  Van Andel
  \citeyear[p. 643]{van1994anatomy} estimates that in twenty percent
  of innovations ``something was discovered before there was a demand
  for it.''  To illustrate the role of this factor, it may be most
  revealing to consider a counterexample, in a case where dynamics
  were not attended to carefully and the outcome suffered as a result.
  Cropley \citeyear{cropley2006praise} describes the pathologist Eugen
  Semmer's failure to recognise the importance of the role of
  \emph{penicillium notatum} in restoring two unwell horses to health:
  ``Semmer saw the horses' return to good health as a problem that
  made it impossible for him to investigate the cause of their death,
  and reported \ldots\ on how he had succeeded in eliminating the
  mould from his laboratory!''  Whereas readiness to revise the
  approach as the situation changes is an important aspect of a prepared
  mind \cite{bereiter1997situated}, the changing situation itself
  clearly makes a contribution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiple contexts}: One of the dynamical aspects at play
  may be the discoverer/inventor going back and forth between
  different contexts with different stimuli.  3M employee Arthur Fry
  sang in a church choir and needed a good way to mark pages in his
  hymn book -- and happened to have been recently attending internal
  seminars offered by his colleague Spencer Silver about restickable
  glue.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiple tasks}: Einstein's work at the patent office
  seems to have been fortuitous not because it gave him ideas, but
  because it gave him time to work on his ideas.  Famously, this
  resulted in four fundamental papers in 1905.  Two decades later,
  translating his correspondent Satyendra Nath Bose's paper from
  English to German, Einstein learned a calculation method that
  produced accurate physical results -- and that implicitly made
  nonstandard physical assumptions \cite{delbruck1980bose}.
  Subsequent examination of these ideas led to the discovery of
  Bose-Einstein statistics, which describes particles that do not obey
  the Pauli exclusion principle.  The potential for interrelationships
  between the tasks is especially relevant, along with the ability to
  carry the tasks through to a satisfactory degree.  In John Barth's
  \citeyearpar{barth1992last} novel \emph{The Last Voyage of Somebody
    the Sailor}, the author gives himself three main tasks: writing
  what reads as a straightforward semi-autobiographical novel,
  adapting a classic fairy tale, and interweaving (and finally
  merging) these two stories.  The result includes numerous examples
  of what the text refers to as ``logistically assisted serendipity''
  \cite[p.~311]{barth1992last}, through the use of images and plot
  points that repeat-with-variation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiple influences}: The bridge from trigger to result
  is often found by making use of a social network.  For example, Arno
  Penzias and Robert Wilson, working at Bell Labs, used a large
  antenna to detect radio waves that were relayed by bouncing off
  satellites.  After they had removed interference effects due to
  radar, radio, and heat, they found residual ambient noise that
  couldn't be eliminated.  They were mystified, and only understood
  the significance of their work after a friend at MIT told them about
  a preprint by astrophysicists at near-by Princeton, who had
  hypothesised the possibility of measuring radiation released by the
  big bang.
\end{itemize}

\noindent In Sections \ref{sec:our-model} and
\ref{sec:computational-serendipity}, we will show how the key
condition, components, dimensions and environmental factors of
serendipity discussed here can be modelled and assessed in
computational systems.
