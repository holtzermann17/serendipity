\section{Literature review} \label{sec:literature-review}

In this section, we give a short overview covering the etymology of
the term ``serendipity'' and trace its development in order to pin
down the key commonalities from many definitions and instances.  In
particular, we point out key conditions of serendipity, their
components and general characteristics, including environmental
factors.  The structure of this section follows and updates an earlier
survey from \citeA{pease2013discussion}.

\subsection{Etymology and selected definitions} \label{sec:overview-serendipity}
The English term ``serendipity'' derives from the 1302 long poem ``Eight Paradises'', written in Persian by the Sufi poet Am\={\i}r Khusrow in Uttar Pradesh.\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasht-Bihisht}}  In the English-speaking world, its first chapter became known as ``The Three Princes of Serendip'', where ``Serendip'' represents the Old Tamil-Malayalam word for Sri Lanka (%{\tam சேரன்தீவு},
\emph{Cerantivu}), ``island of the Ceran kings.''

The term ``serendipity'' is first found in a 1557 letter by Horace Walpole to Horace Mann:
\begin{quote}
\emph{``This discovery is almost of that kind which I call serendipity, a very expressive
word} \ldots \emph{You will understand it better by the derivation than by the
definition. I once read a silly fairy tale, called The Three Princes of Serendip:
as their Highness travelled, they were always making discoveries, by accidents
\& sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of}[.]''~\cite[p. 633]{van1994anatomy}
\end{quote}
The term became more widely known in the 1940s through studies of serendipity as a factor in scientific discovery, surveyed by Robert Merton and Elinor Barben \citeyear{merton} in their 1957 analyis ``The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity, A Study in Historical Semantics and the Sociology of Sciences''.  Merton and Barben define the term as follows:
\begin{quote}
\emph{``The serendipity pattern refers to the fairly common experience of observing
an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion
for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory.''} \cite[p. 635]{van1994anatomy}
\end{quote}
In 1986, Philippe Qu\'eau described serendipity as ``the art of
finding what we are not looking for by looking for what we are not
finding'' \cite{eloge-de-la-simulation}, as quoted in
\cite[p. 121]{Campos2002}.  Pek van Andel
\citeyear[p. 631]{van1994anatomy} describes it simply as ``the art of
making an unsought finding''.

Roberts \citeyear[pp. 246--249]{roberts} records 30 entries for the term ``serendipity'' from English language dictionaries dating from 1909 to 1989.  
%
Classic definitions require the investigator not to be aware of the problem they serendipitously solve, but this criterion has largely dropped from dictionary definitions. Only 5 of Roberts' collected definitions explicitly say ``not sought for.''  Roberts characterises ``sought findings'' in which an accident leads to a discovery with the term \emph{pseudoserendipity} \cite{chumaceiro1995serendipity}.
%
While Walpole initially described serendipity as an event (a discovery), it has since been reconceptualised as a psychological attribute, a matter of sagacity on the part of the discoverer: a ``gift'' or ``faculty'' more than a ``state of mind.''  Only one of the collected definitions, from 1952, defined it solely as an event, while five define it as both event and attribute.

However, there are numerous examples that exhibit features of
serendipity which develop on a social scale rather than an individual
scale.  For instance, between Spencer Silver's creation of high-tack,
low-adhesion glue in 1968, the invention of a sticky bookmark in 1973,
and the eventual launch of the distinctive canary yellow re-stickable
notes in 1980, there were many opportunities for
Post-its\texttrademark\ \emph{not} to have come to be
\cite{tce-postits}. Accordingly, Merton and Barber argue that the
psychological perspective needs to be integrated with a
\emph{sociological} one.\footnote{ ``For if chance favours prepared
  minds, it particularly favours those at work in microenvironments
  that make for unanticipated sociocognitive interactions between
  those prepared minds. These may be described as serendipitous
  sociocognitive microenvironments'' \cite[p. 259--260]{merton}.}
Large-scale scientific and technical projects generally rely on the
``convergence of interests of several key actors''
\cite{companions-in-geography}, along with other supporting cultural
factors.  Umberto Eco \citeyear{eco2013serendipities} focuses on the
historical role of serendipitous mistakes and falsehoods in the
production of knowledge.

It is important to note that serendipity is usually discussed within
the context of \emph{discovery}, rather than \emph{creativity},
although in typical parlance these terms are closely related
\cite{jordanous12jims}.  Henri Bergson's distinction will be useful in
what follows:
\begin{quote}
``\emph{Discovery, or uncovering, has to do with what already exists,
    actually or virtually; it was therefore certain to happen sooner
    or later.  Invention gives being to what did not exist; it might
    never have happened.}''~\cite{bergson2010creative}
\end{quote}
Serendipity, as we understand the term, would seem to require features
of both; that is, the discovery of something unexpected and the
invention of an application for the same.  We must complement analysis
with synthesis \cite{delanda1993virtual}.  The balance between these
two features will differ from case to case.  In the following section,
we will elaborate on the characteristics of serendipity with
particular reference to classic examples.

\textbf{[Here I think it would also be worth mentioning that the idea
    of serendipity had an influence on Voltaire, especially in the
    work `Zadig', and that the `method of Zadig' was an influence on
    the genre of detective fiction, and arguably even on detective
    work.]}


\subsubsection*{Key condition for serendipity}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Focus shift}: 
``\emph{After removing several of the burdock burrs (seeds) that kept sticking to his clothes and his dog's fur, he became curious as to how it worked. He examined them under a microscope, and noted hundreds of `hooks' that caught on anything with a loop, such as clothing, animal fur, or hair. He saw the possibility of binding two materials reversibly in a simple fashion, if he could figure out how to duplicate the hooks and loops.}''~\cite{wiki:velcro}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Components of serendipity}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Prepared mind}: 
Fleming's ``prepared mind'' included his focus
on carrying out experiments to investigate influenza as well as his
previous experience that foreign substances in petri dishes can kill
bacteria.  He was concerned above all with the question ``Is there a
substance which is harmful to harmful bacteria but harmless to human
tissue?''  \cite[p. 161]{roberts}.
%%
\item \textbf{Serendipity trigger}: The trigger does not directly
  cause the outcome, but rather, inspires a new insight.  It was long
  known by Quechua medics that cinchona bark stops shivering.  In
  particular, it worked well to stop shivering in malaria patients, as
  was observed when malarial Europeans first arrived in Peru.  The
  joint appearance of shivering Europeans and a South American remedy
  was the trigger.  That an extract from cinchona bark can cure and
  can even prevent malaria was subsequently revealed.
%%
\item \textbf{Bridge}: These include reasoning techniques, such as
  abductive inference (what might cause a clear patch in a petri
  dish?); analogical reasoning (de Mestral constructed a target domain
  from the source domain of burs hooked onto fabric); and conceptual
  blending (Kekul\'e blended his knowledge of molecule structure with
  his vision of a snake biting its tail).  The bridge may also rely on
  new social arrangements, such as the formation of cross-cultural
  research networks.
%%
\item \textbf{Result}: This may be a new product, artefact, process,
  hypothesis, a new use for a material substance, and so on.  The
  outcome may contribute evidence in support of a known hypothesis, or
  a solution to a known problem.  Alternatively, the result may itself
  be a {\em new} hypothesis or problem.  The result may be a
  ``pseudoserendipitous'' in the sense that it was {\em sought}, while
  nevertheless arising from an unknown, unlikely, coincidental or
  unexpected source.  More classically, it is an \emph{unsought}
  finding, such as the discovery of the Rosetta stone.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Dimensions of serendipity}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Chance}: Fleming \citeyear{fleming} noted: ``There are
  thousands of different moulds'' -- and ``that chance put the mould
  in the right spot at the right time was like winning the Irish
  sweep.''
%%
\item \textbf{Curiosity}: Venkatesh Rao \citeyear{rao2011tempo} refers
  to a \emph{cheap trick} that takes place early on in a narratives in
  order to establish preliminary conditions of order.  Curiosity with
  can play this role, and can dispose a creative person to continue a
  search, looking in unexpected places.
%%
\item \textbf{Sagacity}: This old-fashioned word is related to
  ``wisdom,'' ``insight,'' and especially to ``taste'' -- and
  describes the attributes, or skill, of the discoverer that
  contribute to forming the bridge between the trigger and the result.
  In many cases, such as an entanglement with cockle-burs, many others
  will have already been in a similar position and not obtained an
  interesting result.
%%
\item \textbf{Value}: Note that the chance ``discovery'' of, say, a
  \pounds 10 note may be seen as happy by the person who finds it,
  whereas the loss of the same note would generally be regarded as
  unhappy.  Positive judgements of serendipity by a third party would
  be less likely in scenarios in which ``One man's loss is another
  man's gain'' than in scenarios where ``One man's trash is another
  man's treasure.''  If possible we prefer this sort of independent
  judgement \cite{jordanous:12}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Environmental factors}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dynamic world}: Information about the world develops
  over time, and is not presented as a complete, consistent whole.  In
  particular, value may come later.  Van Andel
  \citeyear[p. 643]{van1994anatomy} estimates that in twenty percent
  of innovations ``something was discovered before there was a demand
  for it.''
%%
\item \textbf{Multiple contexts}: One of the dynamical aspects at play
  may be the discoverer going back and forth between different
  contexts, with different stimuli.  3M employee Arthur Fry sang in a
  church choir and needed a good way to mark pages in his hymn book.
  He happened to have been going to seminars offered by his colleague
  Silver about restickable glue.
%%
\item \textbf{Multiple tasks}: Even within what would typically be
  seen as a single context, a discoverer may take on multiple tasks
  that segment the context into sub-contexts, or that cause the
  investigator to look in more than one direction.  The tasks may have
  an interesting overlap, or they may point to a gap in knowledge.
  Penzias and Wilson used a large antenna to detect radio waves that
  were relayed by bouncing off of satellites.  After they had removed
  interference effects due to radar, radio, and heat, they found
  residual ambient noise that couldn't be eliminated
  \cite{wiki:cosmic-radiation}.
%%
\item \textbf{Multiple influences}:   The ``bridge'' from trigger to
result is often found through a social network, thus, for instance
Penzias and Wilson only understood the significance of their work
after reading a preprint by Jim Peebles that hypothesised the
possibility of measuring radiation released by the big bang
\cite{wiki:cosmic-radiation}.
