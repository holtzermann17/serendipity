\section{Etymology and selected definitions} \label{sec:overview-serendipity}  \label{sec:literature-review}
The English term ``serendipity'' derives from the 1302 long poem \emph{Eight Paradises}, written in Persian by the Sufi poet Am\={\i}r Khusrow in Uttar Pradesh.\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hasht-Bihisht}}  In the English-speaking world, its first chapter became known as ``The Three Princes of Serendip'', where ``Serendip'' represents the Old Tamil-Malayalam word for Sri Lanka (%{\tam சேரன்தீவு},
\emph{Cerantivu}), ``island of the Ceran kings.''

The term ``serendipity'' is first found in a 1757 letter by Horace Walpole to Horace Mann:
\begin{quote}
\emph{``This discovery is almost of that kind which I call serendipity, a very expressive
word} \ldots \emph{You will understand it better by the derivation than by the
definition. I once read a silly fairy tale, called The Three Princes of Serendip:
as their Highness travelled, they were always making discoveries, by accidents
\& sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of}[.]''~\cite[p. 633]{van1994anatomy}
\end{quote}
The term became more widely known in the 1940s through studies of serendipity as a factor in scientific discovery, surveyed by Robert Merton and Elinor Barber \citeyear{merton} in their 1957 analyis ``The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity, A Study in Historical Semantics and the Sociology of Sciences''.  Merton and Barber define the term as follows:
\begin{quote}
\emph{``The serendipity pattern refers to the fairly common experience of observing
an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion
for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory.''} \cite[p. 635]{van1994anatomy}
\end{quote}
In 1986, Philippe Qu\'eau described serendipity as ``the art of
finding what we are not looking for by looking for what we are not
finding'' \cite{eloge-de-la-simulation}, as quoted in
\cite[p. 121]{Campos2002}.  Pek van Andel
\citeyear[p. 631]{van1994anatomy} describes it simply as ``the art of
making an unsought finding''.


Roberts \citeyear[pp. 246--249]{roberts} records 30 entries for the term ``serendipity'' from English language dictionaries dating from 1909 to 1989.

Classic definitions require the investigator not to be aware of the problem they serendipitously solve, but this criterion has largely dropped from dictionary definitions. Only 5 of Roberts' collected definitions explicitly say ``not sought for.''  Roberts characterises ``sought findings'' in which an accident leads to a discovery with the term \emph{pseudoserendipity} \cite{chumaceiro1995serendipity}.
%
While Walpole initially described serendipity as an event, it has
since been reconceptualised as a psychological attribute, a matter of
sagacity on the part of the discoverer: a ``gift'' or ``faculty'' more
than a ``state of mind.''  Only one of the collected definitions, from
1952, defined it solely as an event, while five define it as both
event and attribute.

However, there are numerous examples that exhibit features of
serendipity which develop on a social scale rather than an individual
scale.  For instance, between Spencer Silver's creation of high-tack,
low-adhesion glue in 1968, the invention of a sticky bookmark in 1973,
and the eventual launch of the distinctive canary yellow re-stickable
notes in 1980, there were many opportunities for
Post-its\texttrademark\ \emph{not} to have come to be
\cite{tce-postits}. Accordingly, Merton and Barber argue that the
psychological perspective needs to be integrated with a
\emph{sociological} one.\footnote{ ``For if chance favours prepared
  minds, it particularly favours those at work in microenvironments
  that make for unanticipated sociocognitive interactions between
  those prepared minds. These may be described as serendipitous
  sociocognitive microenvironments'' \cite[p. 259--260]{merton}.}
Large-scale scientific and technical projects generally rely on the
``convergence of interests of several key actors''
\cite{companions-in-geography}, along with other supporting cultural
factors.  Umberto Eco \citeyear{eco2013serendipities} focuses on the
historical role of serendipitous mistakes and falsehoods in the
production of knowledge.

It is important to note that serendipity is usually discussed within
the context of \emph{discovery}, rather than \emph{creativity},
although in typical parlance these terms are closely related
\cite{jordanous12jims}.  In our definition of serendipity, we have
made use of Henri Bergson's distinction:
\begin{quote}
``\emph{Discovery, or uncovering, has to do with what already exists,
    actually or virtually; it was therefore certain to happen sooner
    or later.  Invention gives being to what did not exist; it might
    never have happened.}''~\cite{bergson2010creative}
\end{quote}
As we have indicated serendipity would seem to require features of
both; that is, the discovery of something unexpected and the invention
of an application for the same.  We must complement \emph{analysis}
with \emph{synthesis} \cite{delanda1993virtual}.  The balance between
these two features will differ from case to case.

In the next subsection we will review several historical examples.
First, one further point should be made with reference to the ``The
Three Princes of Serendip''.  Prior to Walpole's coinage, this story
had been adapted by Voltaire into an early chapter of \emph{Zadig},
and in turn ``the method of Zadig'' informed subsequent approaches
both to fiction writing and natural science.  This method is rooted
firstly in discovery:

\begin{quote}
``[Zadig] \emph{pry’d into the Nature and Properties of Animals and
    Plants, and soon, by his strict and repeated Enquiries, he was
    capable of discerning a Thousand Variations in visible Objects,
    that others, less curious, imagin’d were all
    alike.}''~\cite[pp. 21--22]{zadig}
\end{quote}

\noindent Secondly, from disparate observations, Zadig is often able
to assemble a coherent picture:
\begin{quote}
\emph{It was his peculiar Talent to render Truth as obvious as
  possible: Whereas most Men study to render it intricate and
  obscure.}~\cite[p. 54]{zadig}
\end{quote}
Similarly, but in reverse, a coherent picture may be reduced to
fragmented pieces each of which may tell a very different story from
the whole.  This is illustrated in Zadig's misadventure with a broken
tablet, in which one fragment of a poem of praise reads as treasonous
provocation.  In describing the various features of serendipity below,
we will draw connections with the schematic diagram presented in
Section \ref{specs-overview}, in order to unfold the multifaceted
notion of serendipity.
