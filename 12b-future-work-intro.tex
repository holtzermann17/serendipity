\subsection{Future Work} \label{sec:futurework} \label{sec:hatching}

In looking for ways to manage and encourage serendipity, we are drawn
to the approach taken by the \emph{design pattern} community
\cite{alexander1999origins}.
%% The essential features of this approach
%% are described below, but we point out straight away that we propose to
%% use design patterns in rather nonstandard fashion.  These adaptations
%% to the typical design pattern methodology are proposed to parallel the
%% four themes outlined above.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item[(1)] We want to encode our design patterns directly in runnable
%%   programs, not just give them to programmers as heuristic guidance.
%% \item[(2)] We want the (automated) programmer to generate new design
%%   patterns, not just apply or adapt old ones.
%% \item[(3)] We want our design patterns themselves, working in
%%   combination, to contribute to the discovery of new emergent problems
%%   and patterns, not just capture the solutions to existing known
%%   problems.
%% \item[(4)] We want our design patterns to play an overt role in the
%%   dynamical systems they describe.
%% \end{itemize}

\citeA{meszaros1998pattern} describe the typical scenario for authors of design
patterns: ``You are an experienced practitioner in your
field. You have noticed that you keep using a certain solution to a
commonly occurring problem. You would like to share your experience
with others.''  There are many ways to describe a solution.
Meszaros and Doble remark, ``What sets patterns apart is their
ability to explain the rationale for using the solution (the `why') in
addition to describing the solution (the `how').''  Regarding the
criteria that pattern writers seek to address: ``The most appropriate
solution to a problem in a context is the one that best resolves the
highest priority forces as determined by the particular context.'' 
%
%% Their article describes a number of criteria relevant to writing
%% good design patterns, e.g. \emph{Clear target audience},
%% \emph{Visible forces}, and \emph{Relationship to other patterns}.
%
A good design pattern \emph{describes} the resolution of forces in the
target domain; in the setting we're interested in, creating a new
design pattern also \emph{effects} a resolution of forces directly.
The use case of design pattern development maps into our diagram of
the basic features of serendipity described in Figure \ref{fig:1b}:
