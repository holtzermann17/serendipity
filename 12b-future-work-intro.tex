\subsection{Future Work} \label{sec:futurework} \label{sec:hatching}

In looking for ways to manage and encourage serendipity, we are drawn
to the approach taken by the \emph{design pattern} community
\cite{alexander1999origins}.
%% The essential features of this approach
%% are described below, but we point out straight away that we propose to
%% use design patterns in rather nonstandard fashion.  These adaptations
%% to the typical design pattern methodology are proposed to parallel the
%% four themes outlined above.
%% \begin{itemize}
%% \item[(1)] We want to encode our design patterns directly in runnable
%%   programs, not just give them to programmers as heuristic guidance.
%% \item[(2)] We want the (automated) programmer to generate new design
%%   patterns, not just apply or adapt old ones.
%% \item[(3)] We want our design patterns themselves, working in
%%   combination, to contribute to the discovery of new emergent problems
%%   and patterns, not just capture the solutions to existing known
%%   problems.
%% \item[(4)] We want our design patterns to play an overt role in the
%%   dynamical systems they describe.
%% \end{itemize}
%%
\citeA{meszaros1998pattern} describe the typical scenario for authors of design
patterns:
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``You are an experienced practitioner in your field.  You
have noticed that you keep using a certain solution to a commonly
occurring problem.  You would like to share your experience with
others.''
\end{quote}
There are many ways to describe a solution.
Meszaros and Doble remark,
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``What sets patterns apart is their ability to explain the
rationale for using the solution (the `why') in addition to describing
the solution (the `how').''
\end{quote}
Regarding the criteria that pattern writers seek to address: 
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``The most appropriate solution to a problem in a context is
the one that best resolves the highest priority forces as determined
by the particular context.''
\end{quote}

%
%% Their article describes a number of criteria relevant to writing
%% good design patterns, e.g. \emph{Clear target audience},
%% \emph{Visible forces}, and \emph{Relationship to other patterns}.
%
A good design pattern describes the resolution of forces in the target
domain, and applying the solution achieves this resolution of forces.
The design pattern itself is valuable because it achieves something further:
it encapsulates knowledge in a brief, shareable form (often with
meaningful relationships to other patterns).  

The steps in this description match the schematic outline of the key
features of serendipity, as illustrated in Figure
\ref{fig:pattern-schematic} (compare Figure \ref{fig:1b}).  The
discovery/invention of a new design pattern would seen as
serendipitous according to our model, though the SPECS

\begin{figure}
\input{pattern-schematic-tikz.tex}
\caption{The components of design patterns mapped to our process schematic\label{fig:pattern-schematic}}
\end{figure}

%% Here we do not mean to suggest that every instance of ``a solution to a
%% problem in a context'' is due to serendipity at work -- on the
%% contrary, that is just the discovery step.  Inventing a viable design pattern
%% only happens when the solution is found to be explicable and useful.

To van Andel's assertion that ``The very moment I can plan or
programme `serendipity' it cannot be called serendipity anymore,'' we
would reply that we can certainly describe patterns (and programs)
with built-in indeterminacy.  Figure \ref{fig:va-pattern-figure}
presents an example, showing how one of van Andel's patterns of
serendipity can be rewritten as a design pattern using the standard
template.

\end{flushright}
\vspace{-.15cm}
\begin{description}[itemsep=2pt]
\item[{\tt context}] -- You run a creative organisation with several different divisions and many contributors with different expertise.  
\item[{\tt problem}] -- One of the members of your organisation
  discovers something with interesting properties, but no one
  knows how to turn it into a product with industrial or commercial application.
\item[{\tt solution}] -- Create a space for sharing and discussing
  interesting ideas on an ongoing basis.
\item[{\tt rationale}] -- You suspect it's possible that one of the
  other members of the firm will come up with an idea about an
  application; you know that if a potential application is found, it
  may not be directly marketable, but at least there will be a
  prototype that can be concretely discussed.
\item[{\tt resolution}] -- The \emph{Successful error} pattern
  rewritten using this template is an example of a similar
  prototype, showing that serendipity can be talked about in
  terms of design patterns.
\end{description}

In future work, we would aim to build a more complete pattern language
along similar lines, and show how this language can be used to
transform raw data into ``strategic data.''
%
The example pattern describes a scenario that is quite close to Pease et al.'s \citeyear{pease2013discussion} description of an online
system that gathers new modules over time, and for which,
periodically, new combinations of modules can yield new and
interesting results.
%
Developing experiments along these lines may help prepare the
groundwork for the more involved development projects discussed in the
current paper.
%
Patterns of serendipity, like the one in Figure \ref{fig:va-pattern-figure},
offer useful heuristic guidelines for human programmers and convey a sense of our long-term
plans for serendipitous computing systems.



% Is ``having a stretch goal'' an example of a serendipity pattern?  I think so!
