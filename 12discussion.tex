In the preceding section, we applied our model to evaluate the serendipity of an evolutionary music improvisation system, a class of next-generation recommender systems, and a multi-agent system for assembling flowcharts.  The model has helped to highlight directions for development that would increase the potential for serendipity in existing systems, either incrementally or more transformatively.  The model has helped create a reasonably concrete system design.  Our analysis of these examples illustrates some of steps that can be taken in order to design systems that can observe events that would otherwise not be observed, take an interest in them, and transform observations into artefacts with lasting value.  We will now discuss implications from our findings for future research, and outline potential next steps.

The features of our model match and expand upon Merton's
\citeyear{merton1948bearing} description of the ``serendipity
pattern.'' $T$ is an unexpected observation; $T^\star$ highlights its
interesting or anomalous features and recasts them as ``strategic
data.''  Finally, the result $R$ and its evaluation may lead to
updates to the system's operations that will inform further phases of
research.
