In the preceding section, we applied our model to evaluate the serendipity of an evolutionary music improvisation system, a hypothetical class of next-generation recommender systems, and a system for assembling flowcharts.  The model has helped to highlight directions for development that would increase the potential for serendipity in existing systems, either incrementally or more transformatively.  Our model suggested case studies of systems that can observe events that would otherwise not be observed, take an interest in them, and transform the observations into artefacts with lasting value.  We will now discuss implications from our findings for future research, and outline potential next steps.

\subsection{Challenges for future research} \label{sec:recommendations}

Viewing the concepts in Section \ref{sec:by-example} through the
practice scenarios we have discussed, we can describe the following
challenges for research in computational serendipity.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Autonomy}: Our case studies in Section
  \ref{sec:computational-serendipity} highlight the potential value of
  increased autonomy on the system side.
The search for connections that make raw data into ``strategic data''
is an appropriate theme for research in computational intelligence and
machine learning to grapple with.  In the standard cybernetic model,
we control computers, and we also control the computer's operating
context.  There is little room for serendipity if there is nothing
outside of our direct control.  In contrast to this mainstream model,
von Foerster \citeyear[p. 286]{von2003cybernetics} advocated a
second-order cybernetics in which ``the observer who enters the system
shall be allowed to stipulate his own purpose.''  \emph{A
  primary challenge to the serendipitous operation of computers is
  developing computational agents that specify their own problems.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Learning}: Each of the case studies considered in
  Section \ref{sec:computational-serendipity} describes a system that
  is able, in one way or another, to learn from experience.  As we
  considered ways to enhance measures of serendipity in these
  examples, we were led to consider computational agents that
  participate meaningfully in ``our world'' rather than in a
  circumscribed microdomain.  \emph{A second challenge is for
    computational agents to learn more and more about the world we
    live in.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Sociality}: We may be aided in our pursuit of the
  ``smart mind'' required for serendipity by recalling Turing's
  proposal that computers should ``be able to converse with each other
  to sharpen their wits'' \cite{turing-intelligent}.  Turing
  recognised that computers would have to be coached in the direction
  of social learning, but that once they attain that standard they
  will learn much more quickly.  The four supportive factors for
  serendipity described in this paper resemble nothing more than our
  experience of social reality.  \emph{A third challenge is for
    computational agents to interact in a recognisably social way with
    us and with each other, resulting in emergent effects.}
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Embedded evaluation}:
  \citeA{stakeholder-groups-bookchapter} outline a general programme
  for computational creativity, and examined perceptions of creativity
  in computational systems found among members of the general public,
  computational creativity researchers, and existing creative
  communities.  We should now add a fourth important ``stakeholder''
  group in computational creativity research: computer systems
  themselves.  System designers need to teach their systems how to
  make evaluations in way that is both reasonable and ethical.  This
  condition is exemplified by the preference for a ``non-zero sum''
  criterion for value introduced in Section \ref{sec:by-example}.
  \emph{A fourth challenge is for computational agents to evaluate
    their own creative process and products.}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Future Work} \label{sec:futurework} \label{sec:hatching}

In looking for ways to manage and encourage serendipity, we are drawn
to the approach taken by the \emph{design pattern} community
\cite{alexander1999origins}. 
\citeA{meszaros1998pattern} describe the typical scenario for authors of design patterns:
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``You are an experienced practitioner in your field.  You
have noticed that you keep using a certain solution to a commonly
occurring problem.  You would like to share your experience with
others.''
\end{quote}
There are many ways to describe a solution.
Meszaros and Doble remark,
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``What sets patterns apart is their ability to explain the
rationale for using the solution (the `why') in addition to describing
the solution (the `how').''
\end{quote}
Regarding the criteria that pattern writers seek to address: 
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``The most appropriate solution to a problem in a context is
the one that best resolves the highest priority forces as determined
by the particular context.''
\end{quote}

\textbf{\emph{Successful error}}~
\begin{description}[leftmargin=0\parindent,labelindent=0em,itemsep=2pt]
\item[{Context.}] You run an organisation with {\sl different
  divisions} and contributors with {\sl varied expertise}.  One of
  them discovers something interesting, but no one knows how to {\sl
    turn the discovery into a product}.
\item[{Problem.}]  How can you get value from the discovery?
\item[{Solution.}] Allow people to work on pet projects, and encourage
  interaction between people in different divisions.
\item[{Rationale.}] Prototypes can be discussed, even if they are not
  directly marketable.  Following the interests of contributors
  preserves their autonomy; contact with different points of view
  brings additional knowledge to bear.
\item[{Resolution.}] 
Open discussion can
  expose flaws at any stage, and help guide work in the direction of
  real innovation.  Participants in these conversations
  will learn something, and will help each other maximise the value of
  the discovery.  
\item[{Example.}] Low-tack restickable glue, discovered by a 3M
  engineer in 1968, ultimately proved useful for making
  Post-it\texttrademark\ Notes, which were launched in 1980 after
  several rounds of in-house prototyping.

%% Their article describes a number of criteria relevant to writing
%% good design patterns, e.g. \emph{Clear target audience},
%% \emph{Visible forces}, and \emph{Relationship to other patterns}.
%
Applying the solution achieves this resolution of forces, and a design
pattern shows how this works.  The design pattern itself achieves
something further: it encapsulates knowledge in a brief, shareable
form, often with meaningful relationships to other patterns.  Tracing
the steps involved, we see that the creation of a new design pattern
is always somewhat serendipitous (Figure \ref{fig:pattern-schematic};
compare Figure \ref{fig:1b}).

\end{figure}

\vspace{-.3cm} To van Andel's assertion that ``The very moment I can
plan or programme `serendipity' it cannot be called serendipity
anymore,'' we reply that we can certainly describe patterns -- and
programs -- with built-in indeterminacy.  We can foster circumstances
that may make an unexpected happy outcome more likely.  Figure
\ref{fig:va-pattern-figure} illustrates this with one van Andel's
patterns of serendipity, rewritten using the standard design pattern
template.  In future work, we intend to build a more complete
serendipity pattern language -- and to use this within autonomous
programming systems that transform raw data into ``strategic data.''


% Is ``having a stretch goal'' an example of a serendipity pattern?  I think so!
