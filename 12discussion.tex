In the preceding section, we applied our model to evaluate the serendipity of an evolutionary music improvisation system and a class of next-generation recommender systems, and we sketched a design for a multi-agent system for poetry based on the idea of a Writers Workshop.  The model has helped to highlight directions for development that would increase the potential for serendipity in existing systems, either incrementally or more transformatively.  The model has helped create a reasonably concrete system design.  Our analysis of these examples illustrates some of steps that can be taken in order to design systems that can observe events that would otherwise not be observed, take an interest in them, and transform observations into artefacts with lasting value.  We will now discuss implications from our findings for future research, and outline potential next steps.
