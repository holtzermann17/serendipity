\section{Discussion and Related Work} \label{sec:discussion}

In Section \ref{sec:computational-serendipity}, we applied our model
to evaluate the serendipity of an evolutionary music improvisation
system, a hypothetical class of next-generation recommender systems,
and a system for assembling flowcharts.  The model has helped to
highlight directions for development that would increase the potential
for serendipity in existing systems, either incrementally or more
transformatively.  Our model outlines a path towards the development
of systems that can observe events that would otherwise not be
observed, take an interest in them, and transform the observations
into artefacts with lasting value.

In this section, we will show how the model allows for more precise
thinking than other existing work touching on this area.  We then
discuss implications from our findings for future research.

\subsection{Challenges for future research} \label{sec:recommendations}

Reviewing the components of serendipity introduced in Section
\ref{sec:by-example} and crystalised in the definition of serendipity
presented in Section \ref{sec:our-model} in light of the practice
scenarios discussed in Section \ref{sec:computational-serendipity}, we
can describe the following challenges for research in computational
serendipity.  The essential issues were drawn out in Section \ref{sec:related}, and are expanded here.

\paragraph{\textbf{Autonomy}.} Our case studies in Section
  \ref{sec:computational-serendipity} highlight the potential value of
  increased autonomy on the system side.
The search for connections that make raw data into ``strategic data''
is an appropriate theme for research in computational intelligence and
machine learning to grapple with.  In the standard cybernetic model,
we control computers, and we also control the computer's operating
context.  There is little room for serendipity if there is nothing
outside of our direct control.  In contrast to this mainstream model,
von Foerster \citeyear[p. 286]{von2003cybernetics} advocated a
second-order cybernetics in which ``the observer who enters the system
shall be allowed to stipulate his own purpose.''  \emph{A
  primary challenge for the serendipitous operation of computers is
  developing computational agents that specify their own problems.}

\paragraph{\textbf{Learning}.} Each of the case studies considered in
  Section \ref{sec:computational-serendipity} describes a system that
  is able, in one way or another, to learn from experience.  As we
  considered ways to enhance the measure of serendipity in these
  examples, we were led to consider computational agents that
  participate more meaningfully in ``our world'' rather than in a
  circumscribed microdomain.  Knowledge-intensive development work may
  often be unavoidable.  Understanding how to foster serendipity is a
  particularly important step, because it points to the potential of
  systems learning on their own.  \emph{A second challenge is for
    computational agents to learn more and more about the world we
    live in.}

\paragraph{\textbf{Sociality}.} We may be aided in our pursuit of the
  ``smart mind'' \cite{campbell2005serendipity} required for
serendipity by recalling Turing's proposal that computers should ``be
able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits''
\cite{turing-intelligent}.    The four
supportive factors for serendipity described in this paper -- a
\emph{dynamic world}, \emph{multiple contexts},
\emph{multiple tasks}, and \emph{multiple
  influences} -- resemble nothing more than social
reality.  In our analysis of {\sf GAmprovising} we suggested
that a future version of the system should interact more with the listener, and that individual
Improvisers should allow themselves to be influenced by each other,
rather than working in a digital silo.  \emph{A third challenge is for
  computational agents to interact in a recognisably social way with
  us and with each other, resulting in emergent effects.}

\paragraph{\textbf{Embedded evaluation}.}  \citeA{stakeholder-groups-bookchapter} outline a general programme
  for computational creativity, and examine perceptions of
  computational creativity among members of the general public,
  computational creativity researchers, and existing creative
  communities.  We should now add a fourth important ``stakeholder''
  group in computational creativity research: computer systems
  themselves.  System designers need to teach their systems how to
  make evaluations.  We saw that this is a crucial issue in designing
  an automated programming experiment.  The guiding light is a
  ``non-zero sum'' conception of value.  This can be extended to
  situations in which the the ``product'' is a new process or action.
  Within a Kantian framework ``an agent's moral maxims are instances
  of universally-quantified propositions which could serve as moral
  laws -- ones holding for any agent'' \cite{powers2005deontological}.
  Embedded evaluation has pragmatic as well as philosophical
  implacations; thus, for example, the latest implementation of {\sf
    GAmprovising} is limited because it is ``poor at using reasoned
  self-evaluation'' and ``does not generate novel aesthetic measures''
  \cite[pp.~189, 288]{jordanous2012evaluating}.  \emph{A fourth
    challenge is for computational agents to evaluate their own
    creative process and products.}

\subsection{Future Work} \label{sec:futurework} \label{sec:hatching}

In looking for ways to manage and encourage serendipity, we are drawn
to the approach taken by the \emph{design pattern} community
\cite{alexander1999origins}. 
\citeA{meszaros1998pattern} describe the typical scenario for authors of design patterns:

\begin{quote}
\noindent ``You are an experienced practitioner in your field.  You
have noticed that you keep using a certain solution to a commonly
occurring problem.  You would like to share your experience with
others.''
\end{quote}

\noindent There are many ways to describe a solution. Meszaros and Doble remark,
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``What sets patterns apart is their ability to explain the
rationale for using the solution (the `why') in addition to describing
the solution (the `how').''
\end{quote}
Regarding the criteria that pattern writers seek to address: 
\begin{quote}
\noindent ``The most appropriate solution to a problem in a context is
the one that best resolves the highest priority forces as determined
by the particular context.''
\end{quote}

%
%% Their article describes a number of criteria relevant to writing
%% good design patterns, e.g. \emph{Clear target audience},
%% \emph{Visible forces}, and \emph{Relationship to other patterns}.
%
Applying the solution achieves this resolution of forces in the
application domain.
The design pattern itself achieves something further: it encapsulates
knowledge in a brief, shareable form.  Tracing the steps involved, we
see that the creation of a new design pattern is always somewhat
serendipitous (Figure \ref{fig:pattern-schematic}; compare Figure
\ref{fig:1b}).

To van Andel's assertion that ``The very moment I can plan or
programme `serendipity' it cannot be called serendipity anymore,'' we
reply that patterns -- and programs -- can include built-in
indeterminacy.  Moreover, we can foster circumstances that may make
unexpected happy outcomes more likely, by designing and developing
systems that increasingly address the challenges outlined in Section
\ref{sec:recommendations}.  Such systems will encounter unexpected
stimuli, become curious about them, sagaciously pursuing enquiry
within a social context, and assess the value of any outcomes.
%
Figure \ref{fig:va-pattern-figure} shows one example of a design
pattern that can be used to \emph{plan for serendipity}, based on a
pattern identified by van Andel: ``\emph{Successful Error}''.  In
future work, we intend to build a more complete serendipity pattern
language -- and put it to work within autonomous programming systems.

% Is ``having a stretch goal'' an example of a serendipity pattern?  I think so!

\begin{description}[leftmargin=0\parindent,labelindent=0em,itemsep=10pt]
\item[{Context.}] You run an organisation with different
  divisions and contributors with {\em varied expertise}.  People routinely
  discover interesting things that no one knows how to {\em
    turn into a product}.
\item[{Problem.}]  How can you get the most value from this sort of discovery?
\item[{Solution.}] Allow people to work on pet projects, and encourage
  interaction between people in different divisions.  Set aside time
  for in-house seminars.
\item[{Rationale.}] Prototypes can be discussed, even if they are not
  directly marketable.  Following the interests of contributors
  preserves their autonomy.  Contact with different points of view
  brings additional knowledge to bear.
\item[{Resolution.}] 
Open discussion plays to everyone's strengths.  It can
  expose flaws at any stage, and can help to guide work in the direction of
  real innovation.  Participants in these conversations
  will learn something, and will help each other maximise the value of
  the discovery.  
\item[{Example.}] Low-tack restickable glue, discovered by a 3M
  engineer in 1968, ultimately proved useful for making
  Post-it\texttrademark\ Notes, which were launched in 1980 after
  several rounds of in-house prototyping.
