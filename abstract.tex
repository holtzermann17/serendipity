How might the idea of ``serendipity'' be useful in computing?  We will argue that \textbf{[say more here]}.
% \input{background.tex}
We already have methods for evaluating creativity that can be adapted to evaluate serendipity.
%  \input{related-work.tex}
Most prior work that deals with serendipity in a computing context only considers the ``discovery'' part of the definition, but we argue that serendipity also includes an ``invention'' aspect.
% \input{literature}
We survey literature describing serendipitous discovery+invention in science and technology.
% \input{serendipity-in-computational-context}
We then develop several case studies (some historical and some imagined) showing
how serendipitous discovery+invention can work in a computational setting.
% \input{discussion}
From this, we extract recommendations for practitioners in computational creativity, and outline our own plan of work.
