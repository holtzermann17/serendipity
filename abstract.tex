Most prior work that deals with serendipity in a computing context focuses on computational ``discovery''; we argue that serendipity also includes an important ``invention'' aspect.
% 
We survey literature describing serendipitous discovery and invention in science and technology, as well as the etymology and definitions of the term \emph{serendipity}.  We propose a model of computational serendipity that can be used to evaluate computational systems.  To this end we adapt existing recommendations for evaluating computational creativity.
%
We develop case studies that evaluate the serendipity of existing and hypothetical systems.
%
From our analyses, we extract recommendations for practitioners working with computational serendipity, and outline future directions for research.
