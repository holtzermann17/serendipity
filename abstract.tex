Most prior work that deals with serendipity in a computing context only considers the role it plays in ``discovery'', but we argue that serendipity also includes an important ``invention'' aspect.
% \input{literature}
We survey literature describing serendipitous discovery+invention in science and technology.
% \input{serendipity-in-computational-context}
We then develop several case studies (some historical and some imagined) showing
how serendipitous discovery+invention can work in a computational setting.
% \input{discussion}
From this, we extract recommendations for practitioners in computational creativity, and outline our own plan of work.
