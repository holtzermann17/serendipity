Most prior work that deals with serendipity in a computing context focuses on computational ``discovery''; we argue that serendipity also includes an important ``invention'' aspect.
% \input{literature}
We survey literature describing serendipitous discovery+invention in science and technology, as well as the etymology and definitions of the term `serendipity'. We propose a model of computational serendipity, building upon and refining previous work, moving towards computational contexts. We posit our model as a definition of computational serendipity which could then be used to evaluate computational systems accordingly. To this end we adapt existing recommendations for evaluating computational creativity, to fully develop and apply our model for evaluation of computational serendipity.
% \input{serendipity-in-computational-context}
We develop case studies of existing systems and a thought experiment investigating serendipitous discovery+invention in a computational setting.
% \input{discussion}
From this, we extract recommendations for practitioners working with computational serendipity, and outline future directions.
