Most prior work that deals with serendipity in a computing context focuses on computational ``discovery''; we argue that serendipity also includes an important ``invention'' aspect.
% 
We survey literature describing serendipitous discovery \& invention in science and technology, as well as the etymology and definitions of the term ``serendipity''. We propose a model of computational serendipity, building upon and refining previous work. This model suggests a definition of computational serendipity that can be used to evaluate computational systems.  To this end we adapt existing recommendations for evaluating computational creativity, to fully develop and apply our model for evaluation of computational serendipity.
%
We develop case studies that evaluate the serendipity of existing systems, and contrast computational creativity and other disciplines such as recommender systems here for potential mutual benefit. We then present a thought experiment that applies our model in a design for multi-agent environment for computer poetry.
%
From these analyses, we extract recommendations for practitioners working with computational serendipity, and outline future directions.
