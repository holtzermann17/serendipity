Materials, like gold, and processes, like metalurgy, have no value
without a context of application: decoration, trade, circuitry, and so
on.  In practice, we are likely to attribute \emph{value} to materials
that are useful, and \emph{creativity} to a person who puts materials
to use in a novel way.
