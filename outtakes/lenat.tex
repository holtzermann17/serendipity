 It is worth noting that current systems in
computational creativity, almost as a rule, do \emph{not} consume or
evaluate the work of other systems.\footnote{An exception that proves
  the rule is Mike Cook's {\sf AppreciationBot}, which is a reactive
  automaton that is solely designed to ``appreciate'' tweets from {\sf
    MuseumBot}; see \url{https://twitter.com/AppreciationBot}.}
Developing systems that could successfully navigate this collaborative
exercise would be a significant advance in the field of computational
creativity.  Since the experience is about \emph{learning} rather than
winning, there is little motivation to ``game the system''
\cite<cf.>{lenat1983eurisko}.
