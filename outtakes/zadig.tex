In the next subsection we will review several historical examples.
First, one further point should be made with reference to the ``The
Three Princes of Serendip''.  Prior to Walpole's coinage, this story
had been adapted by Voltaire into an early chapter of \emph{Zadig},
and in turn ``the method of Zadig'' informed subsequent approaches
both to fiction writing and natural science.  This method is rooted
firstly in discovery:

\begin{quote}
``[Zadig] \emph{pry’d into the Nature and Properties of Animals and
    Plants, and soon, by his strict and repeated Enquiries, he was
    capable of discerning a Thousand Variations in visible Objects,
    that others, less curious, imagin’d were all
    alike.}''~\cite[pp. 21--22]{zadig}
\end{quote}

\noindent Secondly, from disparate observations, Zadig is often able
to assemble a coherent picture:
\begin{quote}
\emph{It was his peculiar Talent to render Truth as obvious as
  possible: Whereas most Men study to render it intricate and
  obscure.}~\cite[p. 54]{zadig}
\end{quote}

%% Men were much to blame for casting Reflections on the Conduct of
%% the Whole, upon the bare Inspection of the minutest Part

% In the Ruins, he will find an immense Treasure, that
% will enable him, from henceforth, to exert his Beneficence, and render
% his Virtues more and more conspicuous.


%% Topick they entred upon was the Passions. Alas! said Zadig, how fatal
%% in their Consequences! However, said the Hermit, they are the Winds
%% that swell the Sail of the Vessel. Sometimes, ’tis true, they overset
%% it; but there is no such Thing as sailing without them. Phlegm,
%% indeed, makes Men peevish and sick; but then there is no living
%% without it. Tho’ [215]every Thing here below is dangerous, yet All are
%% necessary. In the next Place, their Discourse turn’d on sensual
%% Pleasures; and the Hermit demonstrated, that they were the Gifts of
%% Heaven; for, said he, Man cannot bestow either Sensations or Ideas on
%% himself; he receives them all; his Pain and Pleasure, as well as his
%% Being, proceed from a superior Cause.

%% Mankind in general, said the Angel Jesrad, judge of the Whole, by only
%% viewing the hither Link of the Chain.
