The real problem with computers is not that they only do what they're
told, but that the act of programming forces us to confront the
emergence of the new \cite{mead1932philosophy}.

Indeterminacy forms an important part of any proposal for
``intelligent machines'', after Turing:
\begin{quote}
``\emph{They will make mistakes at times, and at times they may make
    new and very interesting statements, and on the whole the output
    of them will be worth attention to the same sort of extent as the
    output of a human mind}.''  \cite{turing-intelligent}
\end{quote}

Serendipity has played a role in the large-scale history of the
computing field \cite{de2013turing} and in artistic applications of
computer technology \cite{reichardt1969cybernetic}.  We aim to clarify
the role it has to play in the future development of computational
creativity.
