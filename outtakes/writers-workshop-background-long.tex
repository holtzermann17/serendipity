\subsection{Proposed experiment: A Writers Workshop for Systems} \label{sec:writers-workshop}

Richard Gabriel \cite{gabriel2002writer} describes the practise of
Writers Workshops that has been put to use for over a decade within
the Pattern Languages of Programming (PLoP) community.  The basic
style of collaboration originated much earlier with groups of literary
authors who engage in peer-group critique.  Some literary workshops
are open as to genre, and happy to accommodate beginners, like the
Minneapolis Writers
Workshop\footnote{\url{http://mnwriters.org/how-the-game-works/}};
others are focused on professionals working within a specific genre,
like the Milford Writers
Workshop\footnote{\url{http://www.milfordsf.co.uk/about.htm}}.  The
practices that Gabriel describes are fairly typical.  Authors come
with work ready to present, and read a short sample, which is then
discussed and constructively critiqued by attendees.  Presenting
authors are not permitted to rebut these comments.  The commentators
generally summarise the work and say what they have gotten out of it,
discuss what worked well in the piece, and talk about how it could be
improved.  The author listens and may take notes; at the end, he or
she can then ask questions for clarification.  Generally, non-authors
are either not permitted to attend, or are asked to stay silent
through the workshop, and perhaps sit separately from the
participating authors/reviewers.  There are similarities between the
Writers Workshops and classical practices of group composition
\cite{jin1975art} and dialectic \cite{dialectique}, and the workshop
may be considered an artistic or creative space in its own right.

In PLoP workshops, authors present design patterns and pattern
languages, or papers about patterns, rather than more traditional
literary forms like poems, stories, or chapters from novels.  Papers
must be workshopped at a PLoP or EuroPLoP conference in order to be
considered for the \emph{Transactions on Pattern Languages of
  Programming} journal.  A discussion of writers workshops
in the language of design patterns is presented by
Coplien and Woolf \cite{coplien1997pattern}.  Their patterns include:
\begin{center}
{\small
\begin{tabular}{l@{\hspace{.2cm}}l@{\hspace{.2cm}}l}
\emph{Open Review} & \emph{Safe Setting} & \emph{Workshop Comprises Authors} \\
\emph{Authors are Experts} & \emph{Community of Trust} & \emph{Moderator Guides the Workshop} \\
\emph{Thank the Author} & \emph{Selective Changes} & \emph{Clearing the Palate} \\
\end{tabular}
}
\end{center}

We propose that a similar pattern-based approach should be deployed
within the Computational Creativity community to design a workshop in
which the participants are computer systems instead of human authors.
The annual International Conference on Computational Creativity
(ICCC), now entering its sixth year, could be a suitable venue.
Rather than the system's creator presenting the system in a
traditional slideshow and discussion, or a system ``Show and Tell,''
the systems would be brought to the workshop and would present their
own work to an audience of other systems, in a Writers Workshop
format.  This might be accompanied by a short paper for the conference
proceedings written by the system's designer describing the system's
current capabilities and goals.  Subsequent publications might include
traces of interactions in the Workshop, commentary from the system on
other systems, and offline reflections on what the system might change
about its own work based on the feedback it receives.  As in the PLoP
community, it could become standard to incorporate this sort of workshop
into the process of peer reviewing journal articles for the new \emph{Journal of
  Computational Creativity}\footnote{\url{http://www.journalofcomputationalcreativity.cc}}.

In order to facilitate this sort of interaction, it would be necessary
for systems to implement a basic protocol related to
%%
\[
\text{
{\tt presentation}, {\tt listening}, {\tt
  feedback}, {\tt questions}, and {\tt
  reflections}.}
\]
%%
This protocol could be thought of as a light-weight template for
creating design patterns that guide system-level participation in the
context specified by Coplien and Woolf's pattern language for writers
workshops.  Table \ref{tab:reinterpret} uses this framework to recast
the four ``perfectly'' serendipitous patterns from van Andel --
\emph{Successful error}, \emph{Side effect}, \emph{Wrong hypothesis},
and \emph{Outsider} -- in a form that may make them useful to
developers preparing to enter their systems into the Workshop.

Further guidelines for structuring and participating in traditional
writers workshops are presented by Linda Elkin in
\cite[pp. 201-203]{gabriel2002writer}.  It is not at all clear that
the same ground rules should apply to computer systems.  For example,
one of Elkin's rules is that ``Quips, jokes, or sarcastic comments,
even if kindly meant, are inappropriate.''  Rather than forbidding
humour, it may be better for individual comments to be rated as
helpful or non-helpful.  Again, since serendipitous discovery is an
overarching goal, in the first instance, usefulness and interest might
be judged in terms of the criteria described in Section
\ref{sec:evaluation-criteria}.

We would need a neutral environment that is not hard to develop for:
the {\sf FloWr} system described in Section \ref{sec:foundations}
offers one such possibility.  With this system, the basic operating
logic of the Workshop could be spelled out as a flowchart, and
contributing systems could use flowcharts as the basic medium for
sharing their presentations, feedback, and questions.  Developing
around a process language of this sort partially obviates the need for
participating systems to have strong natural language processing
capabilities.  
%
Post-it\texttrademark\ notes, which have provided us with a useful
example of serendipitous discovery, also provide indicative strategies
from the world of paper prototyping (Figure \ref{fig:paper-prototype}).

Gordon Pask's conversation theory, reviewed in
\cite{conversation-theory-review,boyd2004conversation}, goes
considerably beyond what we have presented here as a simple process
language, although there are structural parallels.  In a basic
Pask-style learning conversation: (0) Conversational participants are
carrying out some actions and observations; (1) naming and recording
what action is being done; (2) asking and explaining why it works the
way it does; (3) carrying out higher-order methodological discussion;
and (4) trying to figure out why unexpected results occured \cite[p. 190]{boyd2004conversation}.

Naturally, variations to the underlying system, protocol, and the
schedule of events should be considered depending on the needs and
interests of participants, and several variants can be tried.  On a
pragmatic basis, if the Workshop proved quite useful to participants,
it could be revised to run monthly, weekly, or
continuously.\footnote{For a comparison case in computer Go, see
