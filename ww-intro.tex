\subsection{Thought experiment:  Serendipity by design} \label{sec:ww}

To evaluate our computational framework in usage, we apply a thought
experiment based around a novel computational scenario where there is
high potential for serendipity.  As discussed above, sociological
factors can influence serendipitous discoveries on a social scale.
The exploitation of social creativity and feedback can create
scenarios where serendipity could occur for computers as well.
%
In \cite{poetry-workshop}, we considered multi-agent systems that
learn by sharing work in progress, and discussing partial
understandings.  The thought experiment we apply here explores
serendipity in such scenarios, and is influenced by the ideas of
\citeA{gabriel2002writer} on Writers Workshops.

Following \citeA{gabriel2002writer}
% we described a template for a pattern
% language for interactions in a computational poetry workshop, closely
we define a \emph{Workshop} to be an activity for two or more agents
consisting of the following steps:
%itemize?
{\tt presentation}, {\tt listening}, {\tt feedback}, {\tt questions},
and {\tt reflections}.  In general, the first and most important
feature of {\tt feedback} is for the listener to say what they heard;
in other words, what they find in the presented work.  In some
settings this is augmented with {\tt suggestions}.  After any {\tt
  questions} from the author, the commentators may make {\tt replies}
to offer clarification.

This is how these steps map into the diagram we introduced in Section \ref{sec:our-model}:
