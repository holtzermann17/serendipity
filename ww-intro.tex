\subsection{A Writers Workshop for Systems} \label{sec:ww}

%% \textbf{[It would be good to go back over our other paper and make
%%     sure we make good on the idea in the Related Work section of the
%%     current paper that ``This earlier paper remains broadly
%%     indicative, however, and the ideas it describes can see
%%     considerable benefit from the more formal thinking we develop in
%%     the current work.''}

%% \textbf{In particular: at least one of the reviewers found the Writers
%% Workshop ``technologically unrealistic'' or similar, so let's try to
%% make sure we're not overpromising.  I think the other paper makes it
%% all fairly realistic.]}

%% In \cite{poetry-workshop}, we investigate the feasibility of using
%% designs of this sort in multi-agent systems that learn by sharing and
%% discussing partial understandings.  This earlier paper remains broadly
%% indicative, however, and the ideas it describes can see considerable
%% benefit from the more formal thinking we develop in the current work.

% \citeA{poetry-workshop} describes a Writers Workshop for poetry
%systems. 

Following \citeA{gabriel2002writer}
% we described a template for a pattern
% language for interactions in a computational poetry workshop, closely
we define a \emph{Workshop} to be an activity for two or more agents
consisting of the following steps:
%itemize?
{\tt presentation}, {\tt listening}, {\tt feedback}, {\tt questions},
and {\tt reflections}.  In general, the first and most important
feature of {\tt feedback} is for the listener to say what they heard;
in other words, what they find in the presented work.  In some
settings this is augmented with {\tt suggestions}.  After any {\tt
  questions} from the author, the commentators may make {\tt replies}
to offer clarification.  This is how these steps map into the diagram
we introduced in Section \ref{sec:background}:
