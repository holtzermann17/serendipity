Here we do not mean to suggest that every instance of ``a solution to a
problem in a context'' is due to serendipity at work -- on the
contrary, that is just the discovery step.  Inventing a viable design pattern
only happens when the solution is explicable and useful.

To van Andel's assertion that ``The very moment I can plan or
programme `serendipity' it cannot be called serendipity anymore,'' we
would reply that can also describe patterns (and programs) with
built-in indeterminacy.

Here is one of van Andel's patterns of serendipity rewritten as a
design pattern using the template suggested by our model:

\paragraph{Successful error}
\emph{Van Andel's example} -- Post-it\texttrademark\ Notes\\[.05cm]
\begin{description}
\item[{\tt context}] -- You run a creative organisation with several different divisions and many contributors with different expertise.  
\item[{\tt problem}] -- One of the members of your organisation
  discovers something with interesting properties, but no one
  knows how to turn it into a product with industrial or commercial application.
\item[{\tt solution}] -- You create a space for sharing and discussing
  interesting ideas on an ongoing basis (perhaps a Writers Workshop).
\item[{\tt rationale}] -- You suspect it's possible that one of the
  other members of the firm will come up with an idea about an
  application; you know that if a potential application is found, it
  may not be directly marketable, but at least there will be a
  prototype that can be concretely discussed.
\item[{\tt resolution}] -- The \emph{Successful error} pattern
  rewritten using this template is itself an example of such a
  prototype.
