\subsection{Recommendations} \label{sec:recommendations}

Deleuze wrote: ``True freedom lies in the power to decide, to
constitute problems themselves'' \cite[p. 15]{deleuze1991bergsonism};
von Foerster \citeyear[p. 286]{von2003cybernetics} advocated a \emph{second-order cybernetics} in which ``the observer who enters the system shall be allowed to stipulate his own purpose.''
% Dewey, Whitehead similar too.
Our thought experiment in Section \ref{sec:ww} explores these ideas,
and helps to illustrate the relationship between problem creation and
serendipity.  The search for connections that make raw data into
``strategic data'' is part of this common ground, and an appropriate
theme for researchers in computational creativity to grapple with.

In \cite{stakeholder-groups-bookchapter}, we outlined a general
programme for computational creativity, and examined perceptions of
creativity in computational systems found among members of the general
public, Computational Creativity researchers, and creative communities
-- understood as human communities.  We should now add a fourth
important ``stakeholder'' group in computational creativity research:
computer systems themselves.  Creativity may look very different to
this fourth stakeholder group than it looks to us.  We should give
computers the tools effectively evaluate their own results and their
creative process.

These ideas set a relatively high bar, if only because computational
creativity has often been focused on generative rather than reflective
acts.  As Campbell \citeyear{campbell} writes: ``serendipity
presupposes a smart mind.''  We may be aided in our pursuit by
recalling Turing's proposal that computers should ``be able to
converse with each other to sharpen their wits''
\cite{turing-intelligent}.  Other fields, including computer Chess,
Go, and argumentation have achieved this, and to good effect.

The Writers Workshop described in Section \ref{sec:ww} is an example
of one such social model, but more fundamentally, it is an example of
\emph{learning from feedback}.  The Workshop model ``personifies'' the
wider world as one or several critics.  It is clearly also possible
for a lone creative agent to take its own critical approach in relationship
to the world at large, using an experimental approach to generate
feedback, and then looking for models to fit this feedback.

%% While the pursuit of serendipitous findings may not enhance,
