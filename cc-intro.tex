\section{Serendipity in a computational context} \label{sec:computational-serendipity}

The 13 criteria from Section \ref{sec:literature-review} specify the
conditions and preconditions that are conducive to serendipitous
discovery.  Here, we revisit each of these criteria and briefly
summarise how they can be thought about from a computational point of
view, again focusing on examples.  We then present a thought
experiment \textbf{[Is that really what it is?]} that uses the ideas
to develop a new system design.

\subsection{Some completely realistic examples}

\textbf{[Here we should put examples of real historical systems that
    were designed with serendipity in mind, or that can be interpreted
    that way.  We could also include some completely \emph{formal}
    system (like ``Markov Chain Monte Carlo'') and show how it
    \emph{might} operate in a serendipitous fashion, as well as what
    limitations it runs into in the process.]}
