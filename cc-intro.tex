\section{Serendipity in a computational context} \label{sec:computational-serendipity}

The 13 criteria from Section \ref{sec:literature-review} specify the
conditions and preconditions that are conducive to serendipitous
discovery.  Here, we revisit each of these criteria and briefly
summarise how they can be thought about from a computational point of
view, again focusing on examples.  We then present a thought
experiment that evaluates the ideas described above in the course of
developing a new system design.
