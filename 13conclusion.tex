\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

%
We began by surveying ``serendipity'', developing a broad historical
view, and describing several criteria  which we propose
to be computationally salient.  We reviewed related work; like
\citeA{andre2009discovery}, we propose a two-part definition of
serendipity: \emph{discovery} followed by \emph{invention}.
%
Adapting the ``Standardised Procedure for Evaluating Creative
Systems'' (SPECS) model from \citeA{jordanous:12}, we developed a set
of evaluation standards for serendipity.
%
We used this model to analyse serendipity in the context of
evolutionary music improvisation, recommender systems, and flowcharts.
%
We then reflected back over our definition and analyses, and outlined a programme for
serendipitous computing in the pursuit of \emph{autonomy},
\emph{learning}, \emph{sociality}, and \emph{embedded evaluation} that
would tackle the following challenges:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{A primary challenge to the serendipitous operation of
  computers is developing computational agents that specify their own
  problems.}
\item \emph{A second challenge is for computational agents to learn
  more and more about the world we live in.}
\item \emph{A third challenge is for computational agents to interact
  in a recognisably social way with us and with each other, resulting
  in emergent effects.}
\item \emph{A fourth challenge is for computational agents to evaluate
  their own creative process and products.}
\end{itemize}
%
In the current work, we have limited ourselves to clarifying
conceptual issues surrounding our definition of serendipty, and
examining their design implications.
% 
We indicate several possible further directions for implementation
work in each of our case studies.  We have also drawn attention to
theoretical questions related to program design, with applications to
autonomous programming.  Our examples show that serendipity is not
foreign to computing practice.  There are further gains to be had for
research in computing by planning -- and programming -- for
serendipity.
